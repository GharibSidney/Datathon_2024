Title : Help with understanding ENPH and FSLR
Good morning,

I've been researching about these two companies hoping to understand their difference, but it hasn't gotten to the point I'd like and was wondering if I could get reddit's help.

So far I know: ENPH makes micro-inverters for solar panels and home energy management software that helps increase the energy efficiency. FSLR manufactures panels and solar power systems. Things I'd like to know are...

* Are ENPH's micro-inverters used for both residential and commercial projects? or are they more focused in one area over the other?
* Same question with FLSR's solar panels
* ENPH's micro-inverter technology has been a game changer and is ENPH's moat. Does FLSR have their own moat regarding their manufacturing in solar panels? 

I'm long in renewable solar technology and have \~7% of my portfolio in ENPH. However, I personally think the commercial side of it will bloom before residential, and am trying to find out which company (although they offer different products) is more tied to the commercial side so I can make adjustments to my investment if needed.

Thanks in advance!Comment by Straight_Turnip7056: Enphase is good üëç Anyone who believes in solar, EV charging themes, and power hungry data centers and A.I. needing renewable power, can look at ENPH.¬†


It generally has shown negative beta, and the stock seems to make random, out of sync moves compared to market. Today was an exception.¬†


Has shown strong buy volume spikes around $80.¬†
Comment by ckreddituf: I am heavily invested in ENPH. Here is what I know..

1. ENPH is mostly residential. 65% of the revenue in the US and the rest is from EU. They're expanding in other parts of the world but revenue at the moment is still very low. They have recently introduced products for commercial as well, but revenue is still very negligible.   
2. I am not certain about FSLR. They produce panels - especially for utility scale. With the recent tariffs on panels imported from China, they seem to be more in play.   
3. ENPH has a decent moat on the microinvertor tech, but their strength is their ecosystem - invertors, battery, EV chargers and energy management (last two still fairly new and I anticipate at some point in the future, they'll charge customers a monthly fee as they would help the customer save money on Energy management because of dynamic tariffs in various geos - a few years away though. 

  
I haven't invested in FSLR but I am definitely interested in it.
Comment by stickman07738: After reading this article, I decided to sit on the side lines and watch this time around.  Just too many uncertainties.

Good Luck.

Comment by Longjumping-Seat3581: RemindMe! 1 week
Comment by criteradeli: Haven‚Äôt invested in them but I have traded both. I‚Äôve noticed that while both are very interest rate sensitive FSLR seems to hold up better when there is bad interest rates news. Which makes me think they will do well in favorable interest rate environment Seems they still able to show some earnings in a bad environment for their industry. ENPH less so. They are both best in class in the industry but if I had to pick one for long term it would be FSLR but I haven‚Äôt done a deep dive into their fundamentals. I expect both will pop on cuts but I think FSLR will maintain the pop where ENPH will not because of there is a lot of people underwater on ENPH.
Comment by SxeySteve: FSLR makes panels for utility scale solar. They don't do any residential. They are the industry leader in that segment in the US and have a multi-year backlog of orders.

Their (narrow) moat is a proprietary panel design and manufacturing process that reduces the cost per watt and is much less energy intensive to build.

Chinese manufacturers are heavily subsidized by the state, and are a risk to FSLR's moat. Current protectionist policies are keeping them from flooding the market and crashing prices, but if policy changes it could wipe out their moat.
Comment by TimeTravelingChris: The case against ENPH is that they don't really have any moat. Anyone can make what they make.
Comment by Jeffwul: I would not equate all those things with Enphase. Residential, charging, storage yes. Utility level power including data centers is First solar. I‚Äôm long Enphase. Both are the only investable solar companies to me.¬†

Comment by Jeffwul: I would look closer in this cycle. Enphase continues to turn organic profits despite being residential. First solar percentage profit above enphase is reliant on the IRA tax credits. However I agree long term thesis that first solar would be less affected by interest rate increases as they become more integrated with utilities.¬†

I have been making a killing shorting the small bounces since the high 300s and so are a lot of ppl.

Isn‚Äôt the old saying the trend is your friend ring true ?
Comment by Perfect__Crime: TPG partners, ServiceNow both companies that piqued my interest. Ever heard of them? Their numbers look pretty good
Comment by WinningWatchlist: Hiya- I've been trading the bounces too, but important to note that my position when I write these is literally my position at the writing- I can be long, short, or neutral on a position intraday (after posting)- which is why I write

>Any positions stated aren‚Äôt recommendations, I‚Äôm following subreddit rules to disclose positions.

At this point I should flatten out my position when I write these just so I don't have to write them lol.
Comment by WinningWatchlist: NOW has had a pretty great earnings, but it's a stock that I tend to shy away from just because it's so high-priced, which means less liquidity for trading. I looked through the stocks I've traded recently and SPY and SMCI  were pretty much the highest priced stocks I've traded in a while.



TPG is something I'm not that interested in, asset managers aren't that volatile in general for trading.
Comment by Nateloobz: I'm confused on this one, also. You mention two VERY bearish scenarios (lawsuits due to their negligence), but then say you're in a long position. What about that current situation makes you bullish?
Comment by Perfect__Crime: Thanks, I appreciate you as always
Comment by GlassTailor6361: Big company don‚Äôt go away fast thesis
Comment by WinningWatchlist: >Important to note that my position when I write these is literally my position at the writing- I can be long, short, or neutral on a position intraday (after posting)

My position in CRWD isn't a huge % of my portfolio, I can go to sleep even if this goes to 100 overnight. I'm literally just following the subreddit rules to disclose positions.
Comment by WinningWatchlist: No, I appreciate YOU
Comment by Nateloobz: It can go away slow, but it's still going away. A slow bleed down to nothingness is still the opposite of long.
Comment by Nateloobz: >Important to note that my position when I write these is literally my position at the writing- I can be long, short, or neutral on a position intraday (after posting)

I understand that, but my question is why. You listed the two most bearish things I can think of, and then said you're bullish. I'm a new trader and I'm trying to ask you why.
Comment by GlassTailor6361: Agreed I‚Äôm not touching the thing lol but I‚Äôm saying that‚Äôs the thesis big company go down. Big company won‚Äôt go down more without a fight hopefully
Comment by WinningWatchlist: Because the pain of switching over for most companies will take longer than the disruption itself did- biased opinion: I've spoken to some people in the cybersecurity industry and none of them are even thinking of switching away from CRWD, they're expecting a discount in the future though.



Airlines are unique in that if they screw up their entire travel schedule then their flights are a mess afterwards and it inconveniences the heck out of everyone. Delta is still struggling but other airlines have essentially resumed normal scheduling.

Comment by StrawberrySuperb9229: Google & Amazon
Comment by 35242: CAT - the world will always be building stuff. Heavy equipment will always be needed. Tariffs for foreign heavy equipment will keep CAT more attractive for consumers. 

SO -Southern Company.  An exodus from "Expensive" states to retirement states means utility companies will have more customers. SO is at 54% capacity now,  so a new influx of people means that the current electric infrastructure can nearly double productivity without having to add power plants.   And where it's located (Alabama, Tennessee  Georgia) still has cheap electricity. 

AMZN-  People have moved away from in person shopping.  As the screen generations (Gen Z and younger) age they'll set the precidenr in shop from home services.  Amzn is well ahead of the curve with logistics and distribution centers.  

I'm going to wait on AI companies as it's not yet clear who will take the lead.  But 3 years from now we will start.to see someone making bigger strides than others.
Comment by N05L4CK: I can‚Äôt take an article that lists SOFI as one of the best positioned growth stocks seriously.  And I say that as someone who is long SOFI lol
Comment by Zephyr4813: I believe that with AI, huge market cap tech companies will continue to expand and absolutely dominate. That means NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, and GOOG.

I avoid META and TSLA personally. 

Speculative bets are also on RDDT and COST.
Comment by Zealousideal_Bird_29:  TSM

Everyone keeps saying NVDA but where do they get their chips? TSM
Comment by NorthCliffs: Crowdstrike lmao
Comment by TheiaFintech: AMZN
META
AMD
NVDA
MSFT
GOOG

These companies show remarkable growth, demonstrating strong capital allocation and resilience to competition. They have healthy balance sheets, generate substantial cash flow, and continue to stay at the forefront of innovation. While I can‚Äôt predict which companies will dominate, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if a few of these remain at the top of the list.

Comment by Cobra25k: Amazon, Palantir, Shopify, Crowdstrike, Enphase
Comment by ZarrCon: I don't see how COST can be a "best" growth stock for the next decade. The valuation is too high to offer outsized returns. It's strong performance the last decade was because EPS grew at 12% and P/E grew at 7% (plus a small dividend). Now it sits at 50x+ earnings.

P/E isn't just going to double again in the next decade. So without P/E expansion, you're looking at 12% returns from earnings growth plus the dividend. But wait, what happens if the P/E reverts to something more reasonable, say 30x? Or even 35x? Now your returns are in the 6%-7.5% range. Not terrible of course, but that's more along the lines of what JNJ put up the last decade and not what I'd consider a choice for a top growth stock.

Of course, it could keep trading at 50x earnings and you end up with 12%+ returns, but who will be willing to pay 50x for the stock after another decade of growth? How much bigger can they get at that point and will they continue to grow at high rates?
Comment by Nemisis_the_2nd: As a 10 year hold?


Probably PLTR for me. They took a while to stabilise after the meme stock craze, but they are good at customer retention and landing big contracts. Being somewhat unethical helps with that too.
Comment by NOrthFACE9: Google, Amazon, asts, isrg, transdigm. I like cat and Costco too
Comment by JefeDiez: I‚Äôm surprised META is not on the list considering it hasn‚Äôt even split yet and its cap is over 1T while trading below $500.
Comment by Murky_Raspberry8073: There‚Äôs no such thing as a growth stock per se.

Every good company is a growth company.

Even when you‚Äôre buying a ‚Äúvalue‚Äù company you still want decent growth or even acceleration of growth one day.

Comment by fairlyaveragetrader: Shopify is interesting. I have a feeling 10 years from now some of the things leading are not going to be what they think they are. Every decade is like that. Market cap math is one of the reasons if you look at the history of the United States you don't have companies leading decade after decade. 

That said, I would not buy and hold any singular stock today if I was forced to hold it for 10 years. I would just throw it in the Russell 2000 or s&p 600. Small caps have been underperforming for the past decade, math is on your side holding them for the next decade

Comment by Nemisis_the_2nd: It's going to be rocky over the next few years, but I have good expectations. The problem right now is that they are still to break even (although debt is steadily going down now) but they have also got reduced earnings expectations for 2025, at my time of writing.

Comment by ScottyStellar: Depends how you look at it. It's valued at double tangible book value and it's a bank. In two years they expect to be at .5-.8 EPS and they're valued at 10x that two years in advance. Could sit still for a long time or lose half it's value to be priced alongside normal banks.

If they keep their growth pace though they'll be great in the long run, just can't predict how long they can grow at 20% a year or more.

Comment by Zephyr4813: Of all the bull cases for TSLA's current valuation, EVs being important is probably the least compelling. The arguments for TSLA that justify its value and making it a good investment are 3 fold:

1. Robotaxi

2. Robots that replace warehouse workers and other jobs

3. Energy storage/batteries

Comment by SpiderPiggies: SOFI is a bizarre company to try to value (I do own shares). The last 4 years:

Student loan refinancing company.
Now we're a bank too. Also bought some tech platforms.
Moratorium on student loans? Guess we're a personal loan company now.
Interest rates being held up? MoAr TeCh (guiding for half of revenue from tech by the end of the year)
Next year with interest rates coming down? Who knows, probably increased loan origination?

I can't even begin to guess what percentage of their revenue will come from the banking side of things 4 years from now. Nothing from 20%-80% would surprise me. Doesn't help that they can't talk much about who's thinking of using the tech platform in the months/years ahead.
Comment by SurveyIllustrious738: I never use leverage, too much risky for me.
Comment by woonsc: For those wanting to buy now, which one is the one
Comment by UltraPoss: It's EVS and energy storage , robotaxi and robots that replace warehouse workers and other jobs is the bull case for 10X from here at the very least
Comment by FLFFPM: Just think of it as having Sheldon Cooper as your boss, lol.

As an aside, I've owned TSLA for 12 years.  RIdden all the ups and downs.  Laughed my ass off when Cathy Wood laid out a target of $5k/share long term.  My cost basis overall is about $10.50 (split adjusted), with a total gain of approx. 2600%.

At least cooper is smart, and him being an ass derives from autism (while the writers claim he isn't so he can continue being the butt of jokes) muskbis just a narcissist.

Time will tell.
Comment by EmploymentDense3469: This is obviously more of a political conversation for you. Look at the company and where it‚Äôs headed. It‚Äôs leading the way in EVs and FSD. Not going to sit here and try to convince you. Your mind is made up. Again, invest as you wish.

Title : What do you think of investing more in $TAN (Solar ETF)?
TAN ETF has major holdings in FSLR and RUN, both companies are trading at a low price (for a valid reason i.e. less demand).

TAN has seen high prices in past and it has tendency to shoot up (and then coming down).

I'm not sure if it's meme mania for underlying stocks that powers through TAN.  
In my opinion, alternative energy sources have long term prospectives (when many people keep realizing the potentials). I do see a price point of $75-$80 in next few months.

Comment by ij70: basically keep an eye on fed announcements about interest rates. 

you can buy now, but the price will not go up until interest rate goes down. 

by interest rate going down i mean several consecutive interest rate cuts (economy booming).  not the current outlook of a single rate cut.
Comment by Invest0rnoob1: They‚Äôre interest rate sensitive. They should perform better in the future.
Comment by KeenStudent: First solar trading at low prices? üò≥
Comment by jr1tn: These companies are heavily reliant on billions of dollars of taxpayer subsidies to remain afloat, and deeply unprofitable without this. They are years past the point of when they promised returns to investors and continue to be sub-par investments. Next!
Comment by AcceptableMinute9999: I wouldn't put a nickel into anything solar related.
Comment by yerrmomgoes2college: Rate cuts don‚Äôt mean the economy is booming. If anything they signal the opposite
Comment by EitherPotatoX5093: So if you anticipate rates will go down, eventually, doesn't it make more sense to buy now?¬†


By the time Fed is done with several cuts, stock prices will be already high.
Comment by DeliciousAvocado77: Thanks, that's a good take. I'll keep some portion of my portfolio, for the long run, but you might be right that there are other growth areas that can be focused on.
Comment by NationalOwl9561: This is not right. The stock ROCKETED up to $50 without any severe reduction in interest rates.
Comment by caninloaded: Smart
Comment by NationalOwl9561: Unless we keep importing Chinese solar panels. It's killing US solar panel companies.
Comment by random_relevance: I‚Äôve worked in solar 8 yrs. First solar is overrated, it‚Äôs the Palm pilot of the panel market. Several modules are beginning meaningful manufacturing in the US now, which seems it should help but tariff wars are $$$, I‚Äôm not great at stock reading but I know it costs $.13 in Canada and $.28 to buy the same panel in US right now.
Comment by DeliciousAvocado77: Thanks. What's your reasoning?
Comment by ij70: you are right.
Comment by ij70: that's the tricky question.  you have to chose: locking money in a stock that will do nothing for a couple of years (tan does pay dividend once in a while) or put money to work/grow in nvidia, chipotley, microsoft, amazon, google, etc.  then when rates start to come down sell those positions and move in into the solar stocks.

every person has to decide for themselves what they believe in.
Comment by Invest0rnoob1: Biden put large tariffs on Chinese solar panels
Comment by AcceptableMinute9999: I've lost quite a bit in solar. More states are taking away the benefits of going solar. Solar companies are shutting down because there is no incentive anymore. And new tariffs will drive the price of panels up.
Comment by DeliciousAvocado77: Right! It just seems like everything is so up already!
Comment by NationalOwl9561: So then why are people here acting like that‚Äôs bearish for an ETF that holds US-based solar panel companies? Lol
Comment by NationalOwl9561: Biased. You burnt your hand on the volatility, of course you don't want to invest in it.

Edit: Also, the tariff will drive the prices up meaning more profits, but the prices will still be lower than Chinese imports which means they still beat the competition yet also make more money. Seems good to me!
Comment by Invest0rnoob1: We‚Äôll see in the next couple of earnings if things are improving
Title : Solar powered discussion. 
I‚Äôd like to generate some thoughtful discussion on which solar power companies you think are set to thrive over the next 1-10 years and why. 

To start I‚Äôve been wanting to get back into / more into renewable energy and really like the idea of solar being the play.  Tell me about your thoughts and companies to? 

I‚Äôve been eyeballing $RUN (sunrun) and $FSLR (first solar). I‚Äôve been eyeing $RUN because of their transition into energy storage. I think this is a big play for solar and whoever has the best battery. Without good storage the power is limited in supply. 

I‚Äôve been watching $FSLR because they continue beating expectations, and have powerhouse analysts who have rated this and the stock has already beat their predictions from 2 months ago. 

Anyways, penny for your thoughts on solar plays. Comment by RealmKnight: Solar stocks don't seem to be doing well lately. We're seeing a swing towards pro-fossil fuel governments worldwide, and Chinese manufacturing has created an oversupply of low-cost panels predicted to last for several years. So it's hard for solar companies to make money in this environment. This is reflected in ETFs like Invesco Solar ETF $TAN and Betashares Solar ETF $TANN losing 37% and 29% of their value over the last year. First Solar is an outlier, increasing quite a bit in recent months, so I put a few dollars in there last week. Hoping they can continue to buck the trend.
Comment by sunday_sassassin: It's very difficult for any company to build a strong moat in the solar industry. China can (and does) produce enormous amounts of top-quality panels so there's no supply/demand deficit to profit from. It's a race to the bottom for price, government assistance via tariffs, grants and bans will only go so far. We could easily come to a situation where everything is solar and yet no investment in solar has provided meaningful returns.
Comment by stickman07738: Possibly a good play with [PV Modules imports increasing](https://imgur.com/LAFrmUv), but with the upcoming election - I prefer to watch from the sidelines.
Comment by Fast_Half4523: If we accept that hypothesis that solar will provie us with the largest chunk of primary energy, as nuclear has high capex and overruns budget, then at least some US or EU solar companies should benefit.  Why? 

Because I doubt that the US nor the EU would have their complete energy system being manufactured or run by chinese subsidized companies. Every country would want some autonomy on energy matters. 

Also, the opposition towards solar based from latest EU election is overblown, Le Penn is actually pro solar (and pro nuclear). Von der Leyen proposed the new green deal and she will likely keep her position. 

The tough question is who the winners will be; and apart from FSLR I would guess solar module producers will not join the club easily. Inverter companies might benefit, SMA Solar quite cheap right now (p/e 7.5)

Enphase is right now a bit stretched, maybe solaredge recovers.
Comment by vsMyself: I normally stick to enph as it is almost entirely down because of interest rates hampering installations. I think they handled the recent drawdown very well while solar edge didn't but could violently pop when it does. I am also in icln which is a good coverage. Panels are down huge and sun power just came down from a squeeze.
Comment by Historyissuper: I am afraid investing in solar is kind of like walking in minefield. I believe solar industry will expand and % of power from solar will grow. I do not know who will make money.

1) Solar powerplants kanibalize their own profits. In Europe the price of electricity is negative when solar produce and ~~negative~~ positive when solar doesnt produce. = It doesnt make sense to build and own new solar = whether you profit is determined by laws about selling solar power, which can change.

2) Manufacturing is very standardized. Which company will profit is determined by tarrifs and embargoes. If you buy chinese they can collapse when tarrifs are imposed, if you buy american they can collapse whe tarrifs are lifted.

I believe who will make profits will be determined by political decision outside our control. I am not sure if solar power overall beats the market. Maybe look for somebody who will smartly control solar power, or somebody who will help regulate solar power (batteries,pumphydro,gasturbines,10y from now hydrogen)
Comment by None: [deleted]
Comment by None: Still think solar isn't moving much until the election passes. Biden wins their will be a pump, Trump wins their will be a drop. But long-term, solar stocks will keep moving up.
Comment by 2_Infinity_And_Byond: I am big in to clean grid. I believe the future growth is in clean grid rather than residential. I made good gain on fslr, the only american utility scale solar player. 

My next big bet is FLNC. BESS investment is expected to grow 30-40percent every year until 2030. It has to cuz of climate targets. FLNC have the biggest pipeline&backlog among all bess integrators. They are asset light and does not produce battery cells, so they are risk free from china battery price and wont have to compete against catl for battery.

FY2024 & FY2025 are going to be great for them. Their bess system is now eligible for ira credits, which lowers client's project cost by 50 percent. Their only problem in FY2023 was gross margin, but in FY2025 it will be around 12~15percent (now around 11) with 4 billion in revenue. They are at the profitability inflection point now and price is so attractice. My price target for FY2025 is 31.

Cons would be that bess integrators all have low moat, which FLNC is developing with their software system on top of bess. Another is that FLNC has two customers that acxount for 40 percent of revenue, naturally as they are a joint venture of the said companies. Lastly trump being elected would cause a small dent probably (management doesnt seem to think so).

+ their FY2024 rev is 80percent contracted backlog. 20percent super late stage.
Comment by ZarrCon: What are the economics like on battery storage? Say you charge up the batteries during excess solar capacity (daytime) and sell back when grid capacity is lower than demand (evening, night, morning). Then is it reasonable to say that you make money from the number of charge cycles you complete per battery?

So your production costs include the batteries themselves and infrastructure to support them. If you charge the batteries when its day and discharge the batteries at night (one cycle per day), what sort of profit can you generate? And how long would it take to pay back the battery investment to be in the green on the project? And is that an attractive investment to even make in the first place?
Comment by DesolateShinigami: One of my largest wins. Nextracker and Enphase. I‚Äôve gotten downvoted a lot in the last 10 years or so and have only made profit. 

It‚Äôs very clearly the future unless we get a life changing technology in nuclear, but then so many daily needs would be met. 

FSLR would not be my first priority. Enphase changed the industry.
Comment by Whiskey_Vinyl: My thinking is that clean energy is at a collective low point. Build better back plan has us pretty locked in to commitment to renewables/EVs, trump wont be able to reverse it even if he gets elected.

TSLA is the main exception because of the weirdness around Elon and his pay package.

Anyways, I like ACES ETF right now, and just started via reoccurring to mitigate risk.

I also like cannabis ETFs given the federal declassification of marijuana as a schedule 1 drug.
Comment by Invest0rnoob1: Both seem solid. There is solar ETF TAN.
Comment by None: [deleted]
Comment by obxtalldude: Too much competition, possibility of government distorting markets, and lack of moats keeps me on the sidelines when it comes to PV energy. 

I hope to see every home covered with solar cells, but I just don't see making money from it.
Comment by No-Lavishness-2467: Only nuclear has the energy density to support growth ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. your kids or grandkids might get rich off of space based solar or something tho.

Comment by Chornobyl_Explorer: Short term yes, long term it's irrelevant. Regardless of what nonensene the right/extreme right spreads *climate change is an irrefutable fact* and needs to be addressed (see the UN).




Secondly our need for energy, especially *locally produced* is increasing at a rapid pace. And while building more nuclear is perhaps part of the solution it takes *many, many years* and makes us dependant on nuclear fuel from less then honest countries (Russia).




Haters gonna hate, solar gonna stay. It light not be a guaranteed good investement (who knows) but thearlet for solar will only increase.
Comment by FarResearch7596: You think it would take longer than 10 years for solar plays to maybe become valuable? Because china makes them cheaper and better?
Comment by Straight_Turnip7056: That's one point of view üêª¬†


Looking at bullish side, companies like Enphase energy (ENPH) have patented software/ chips tech around efficient charging, pumping back to grid and really making solar viable for household installations.


Enormous energy that A.I. companies need to power their data centers, training of models etc. can't possibly be just "hooked" from the grid. These companies (Google, FB, for example) have captive solar plants for elec generation.¬†
Comment by FarResearch7596: So would it be safe to assume the best power storage would be a stronger play? Or do you think the current energy giants are funding legislation to slow clean energy progress?
Comment by FarResearch7596: Interesting. Yeah, I don‚Äôt really follow the politics or their party closely, but I haven‚Äôt heard anything about clean energy, or initiatives.
Comment by NationalOwl9561: My argument is that US solar stocks should outperform EU ones in the coming years solely based on interest rates. We can see Europe raising interest rates now while the US is starting to slow down and already talking cuts. P/E's are cool and all, but I wanna know the EPS growth potential too.
Comment by FarResearch7596: Oh yeah, I forgot about hydro. I think that‚Äôs a good one to support too. I‚Äôm not so sure what they‚Äôve been up to lately, but have you been following OPPT (ocean power technologies) by any chance? Penny stock last time I checked, but that‚Äôs the only one I‚Äôve been onto before and have any slight knowledge of.

Comment by FarResearch7596: Wouldn‚Äôt this (summer) be the time all the solar installations would happen for preparation of colder months?
Comment by None: [removed]
Comment by NationalOwl9561: The drop has already been priced in for Trump winning. And the funny thing is, solar stocks performed best and peaked during Trump lol. He is the one afterall the impose Chinese tariffs which helps.
Comment by FarResearch7596: I completely agree that clean grid is the future! I‚Äôll definitely look into FLNC. I‚Äôve never heard of them before. Do you know of any projects they‚Äôre working on now to meet climate accords and where / which states or cities are using their products / services? 
Let‚Äôs pray the election has more preservation for earth, and global causes. Winters aren‚Äôt what they use to be, and we could really use more / better global initiatives on this.
Comment by Pin-Last: Didn‚Äôt they get rid of net metering?
Comment by FarResearch7596: So while I don‚Äôt personally have solar powered units on my home, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm quite qualified to answer the question. But In my case I wouldn‚Äôt be so worried about selling the excess stored energy back to the grid during times where energy consumption is less, (I sleep with the tv on for example) so I assume it would slowly just use the stored energy. 
And as per day hours when the most activity happens in the house, computer microwave, toilets, hot showers, etc, I‚Äôd assume it would save some money by not taking 100% power from the grid. 
I would also like to assume this could help during storms when the grid shuts down because a tree or whatever took out a power line. I kinda think of this as a power bank for my phone (except for my house) and if massive adoption occurred I‚Äôd like to think it would lower power costs because the generators wouldn‚Äôt need to pump out as much energy. I would also think that would lower maintenance costs because the machines aren‚Äôt running so hard. 
But I don‚Äôt know what I don‚Äôt know and I‚Äôm no where close to an electric engineer or specialist in any way, these are all just assumptions.
As far as the costs go, I too wonder how long it would take to essentially ‚Äúpay for the solar power‚Äù with the savings from using less grid power. Likely years last time I checked prices on residential solar projects. But once they‚Äôre there, it‚Äôs there for generations to benefit from. So long term ++
Comment by FarResearch7596: I‚Äôve seen emphase mentioned 3-4x in this thread. How did they change the industry? I‚Äôm definitely going to look into them. I wasn‚Äôt so sure on which way to look at it, the solar farm or the storage of the energy as the best play.
Comment by FarResearch7596: Anything interesting about it? I‚Äôll take a look.
Comment by FarResearch7596: .67% expense ratio? Kind of high??
Comment by stickman07738: I prefer the Iron Flow technology.  GWH
Comment by FarResearch7596: That‚Äôs pretty interesting, never heard of this kind of battery before. Are you watching any tickers? If so why specifically are you interested in their company.
Comment by baeconundeggz: Vanadium redox flow batteries...

Huge in China.
Comment by FarResearch7596: I hope so too, I think we really need to do something to help our environment as much as we can.
Comment by FarResearch7596: I completely agree. At least where I‚Äôm living; there has been a massive amount of new developments. I‚Äôm talking like 20+ apartment buildings, 40+ town home areas, and countless subdivisions with houses lined up all within a 5 - 10 mile radius. And as you expand out 20-30m, it‚Äôs well into the thousands of new housing developments. There‚Äôs a constant growing need for electricity / energy.
Comment by Competitive-Pen7636: I think part of the reason residential solar isn‚Äôt doing well is interest rates. People almost always take a big loan to install solar on their home and it‚Äôs unaffordable right now.

I think long term residential solar needs to come up with a model other than requiring big loans or liens on houses
Comment by Pin-Last: My solar energy insider friend says ENPH is far away best for batteries and inverters. Says it could be a survivor after the wash out from terminating subsidies, the end of net metering, and interest rates.¬†
Comment by None: Those data centers need reliable sources of power. If they are producing on site, they are going to be better off with a Combined Cycle Natural Gas plant.

For solar, it makes more sense to take advantage of cheap daytime wholesale rates and just buy from the grid.
Comment by sunday_sassassin: There's no guarantees that solar w/ battery storage will ever provide a better option for baseline grid power than something like nuclear which is itself "clean"/low carbon in its operation.
Comment by 2_Infinity_And_Byond: I use energy-storage.news for all the clean grid news. You can check all the ongoing projects there!
Comment by ZarrCon: I don't know, I'm just asking how it works. Doesn't seem like a realistically practical solution from my perspective, but maybe I'm missing something. Battery storage isn't cheap and there has to be some sort of financial incentive for it to make sense.
Comment by DesolateShinigami: Mostly their micro inverters. Increased efficiency so much. At this point energy and efficiency is significantly important for our tech reliant world. With such large quantities, those tiny margins mean the difference in billions of costs
Comment by Invest0rnoob1: It‚Äôs just a bunch of solar stocks.  I bought some long dated calls that expire in January.
Comment by Invest0rnoob1: Yeah, it‚Äôs a bit high.
Comment by FarResearch7596: Can you elaborate, I never heard of this either. What makes you more interested in the iron flow? Are you watching any tickers?
Comment by x52x: Hey. DM‚Äôd u a question about spdr rebalance/nvda
Comment by Charming_Squirrel_13: Building large solar farms can be a hassle in America tho. NIMBY gonna nimby. A wind farm and a solar farm were both successfully defeated near me. Then again, nimbys stop nuclear too, so more fossil fuels it is!¬†
Comment by None: Residential solar is much more expensive than utility scale solar. It is only worth it while utilities give generous subsidies, which are getting cut over time.
Comment by FarResearch7596: Makes me wonder if any of the energy giants eg. duke energy is interested in creating a solar farm and somehow intertwining the solar energy directly to the grid saving the company units of production during sunny days, and giving the generators a break needing less output. 
Not an engineer by any means and just stimulating conversation. But it‚Äôs an interesting thought.
Comment by RealmKnight: There are some options for handling the upfront costs. Some political parties have suggested zero-interest loans for installing home solar, which could help a country lower their emissions and reduce spending on carbon credits. Some businesses offer free installation in exchange for a long-term contract that locks in profitable rates for excess power generation they resell to the grid.
Comment by Straight_Turnip7056: OK
Comment by cosmic_backlash: Battery storage is an orthogonal topic to the type of power generated from the grid you draw upon from today.

Battery storage allows redundancy and decentralization, which is dependent on single source of energy (like a nuclear plant).

This is important in the scenarios of extreme conditions (ie, Texas winter).

Which town would you expect to be more resilient? 

1. One with a utility that has natural gas and a wind farm
2. One with a utility that has natural gas and a wind farm, along with 30k homes with a few solar panels and local battery storage?
Comment by None: The future for nuclear power is not looking good. Aging fleet, high construction costs, long build time and mixed political sentiment.

Natural gas is the bigger threat to batteries.
Comment by stickman07738: Na Ion batteries have been in development just as long as Li and now CATL is the only one producing commercial batteries.      They still have complex chemistry issues and short life-time.   There may have a place but I feel LFP batteries will dominant EVs.   Also if government see China controlling the technology - they will shy away.

For me, the market is Energy Storage - Iron Flow technology has over 25 years  life expectancy and enhanced safety.  Utilities do not want to change out systems every 5-10 years.

ESS Tech is gaining a foothold with demonstration units in a number of countries, and I like their partnership with Honeywell.
Comment by Competitive-Pen7636: I think that could happen. I think that since wind and solar fluctuate so much with the environment that battery capacity and energy storage is a huge market. Nuclear and geothermal though provide baseline energy that is supplied regardless of what‚Äôs going on in the environment

I think long term nuclear and geothermal are the answers to energy. Nuclear needs to get over a huge publicity/fear hurdle and geothermal really hasn‚Äôt taken off in America yet
Comment by Competitive-Pen7636: I saw some statistic (haven‚Äôt done the math myself) that if the US wanted to be solar only (not that that‚Äôd happen) then we‚Äôd need a solar farm the size of Spain. Solar also takes up a large land footprint where you then can‚Äôt use the land beneath it for much (yet). Do you want to give up farm land for a solar farm?

In my view, I‚Äôd see solar being a regionally appropriate energy solution in big cities where it could provide covered parking lots and roof tops. Or, a residential surplus. I‚Äôm skeptical of solar farm being a long-term desirable solution. If the underlying thesis for solar is that it‚Äôs good for the environment, I think the trade off of land use for solar farms and preserving the environment aren‚Äôt met. As an extreme example, I‚Äôd prefer a forest with a nuclear plant over chopping down the forest to make room for a solar farm
Comment by None: You are talking about utility scale renewable energy...

Honestly, if this is your level of understanding of renewable energy you should not be investing in it at all.
Comment by sunday_sassassin: Redundancies come with increased costs and diminishing returns. How sound is an investment strategy based around solutions for "extreme condition"? It's a difficult space to pick out clear winners in whom to put your money.
Comment by FarResearch7596: Just curious why you think natural gas would be a threat to batteries? Batteries store the energy, how would gas create / store usable energy for later consumption? Just trying to pick your brain.
Comment by FarResearch7596: I see your point, but I don‚Äôt think it would have to be one giant solar farm. I like to think that outside the big cities would house such farms, maybe even split the farms up to ‚Äúsurround‚Äù the cities to cut the distance it would need to travel. (If that‚Äôs even a necessary thing) 

I like your point though about the space the farms would take up and having the land underneath being un-usable. I also like to think that the cities could use them on roofs, sides of buildings, even building more ‚Äúroofs‚Äù for over sidewalks, which would promote more walking even in inclement weather conditions but could be lined with solar panels on the top.
Comment by cosmic_backlash: You on the internet can't determine a person's need for additional energy based on their circumstances in real life.

There are plenty of other times it's useful, like utility companies that charge surge pricing or have rolling blackouts.
Comment by None: Because its cheaper to use natural gas as a complement to renewables rather than to store the energy and use it later.
Comment by sunday_sassassin: You seem to have drifted pretty far from the actual topic of discussion.
Comment by dida2010: Nuclear is the way to go, China is building a bunch every year, they catching up fast.
Comment by cosmic_backlash: That was my entire point when I said it's an orthogonal topic.

You made a topic that was drifting, and I explained a counter point to your drifting topic.
Comment by None: China is also building a bunch of new coal plants, but I wouldn't call it the future. They need a lot more energy, so they are building everything.

Its a very different dynamic than developed countries with modest changes in energy  demand.
Comment by dida2010: https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-many-15-years-behind-china-nuclear-power-report-says-2024-06-17/
Comment by None: Yeah, the US is also way behind China on high tech coal plants. 

That is the natural result of having a mature energy grid where you are focused on replacing existing plants as they retire rather than expanding the grid.
Title : Buy FSLR or too late/wait for a dip?
I‚Äôm trying to find a good energy company to invest in, as this is likely going to be the next wave that AI hits. (Well, also healthcare).

I waited a little too long and now FSLR has already skyrocketed. No one has a crystal ball obviously, but are they just going higher up or will it dip back? Thoughts? 

Wondering if I missed this train already, or if I should invest a considerable amount starting now. Comment by m4329b: I bought some earlier this year when they said they were booked through 2027 or something. But it going up 50% in a month because it's now an 'AI play' speaks to the absurdity of the market right now
Comment by LostRedditor5: Last time I checked the largest companies were FSLR and enphase

Emphase hasn‚Äôt popped off ytd so maybe you could bet on that 

Solar companies are kind of a gamble on rate cuts imo. If rates are cut they will pop off if they stay higher longer they will stay lower. 

I‚Äôd personally rather just play bonds for rate cuts but I‚Äôm also may have no fucking idea what I‚Äôm talking about so ya know. Do you
Comment by SayNoToBrooms: I opened a position in SEDG yesterday. I‚Äôm an electrician in NY, almost all of the new Solar I see being installed is SolarEdge
Comment by Thalesian: MAXN is another non-Chinese manufacturer of solar panels (best in industry by efficiency). Their financials are a nightmare and they are down significantly from last year. But given the low share price currently, it‚Äôs not expensive to get potential upside exposure to solar if you think it will grow.

SEDGE and ENPH make inverters which are necessary for solar to work, both are down significantly from their highs as well. They are less risky than MAXN. Though my gut (for what it is worth) tells me the admin won‚Äôt let a large non-Chinese solar manufacturer to fail.
Comment by wilan727: Feels to me like that would be chasing gains. But people were saying that about nvidia for years so who knows maybe it's still got life left. But be prepared for volatility with solar plays.
Comment by bigft14CM: I bought in Monday with a price target of $300-$310 by September... I wasn't expecting a run this week.

Comment by arjasonjai: I concur with what Deutsche Bank thinks, which is to wait for a strong indication that channels are stabilizing and under shipments can be mostly done entering into 3Q. It's still early to have a strong position. Although FSLR has solid growth, I would wait for a dip.

Comment by sanfranchristo: Having held a bit of this in an old account since the peak of the green tech wave in the late aughts this makes me chuckle. I‚Äôve checked in on it over the years but was just assuming I‚Äôd sell it at some point for the tax loss. Now I might actually take the modest gain since it‚Äôs in the green. If only buying and holding the other random picks I made then worked as well.

Comment by Street-Pin578: Glad I hold on to it, bought 50 when they were at $40, gained almost 600%. 2nd Best one in my portfolio, only Microsoft gained more.
Comment by bdh2067: The next wave?   Check out $CEG - already doubled this year
Comment by BoboSaintClaire: You‚Äôll be better off with a solar ETF - broader exposure to solar industry in general. 

TAN is a well rounded solar ETF and the top holding is FSLR.
Comment by Daisysmommy: Ffie
Comment by cluskillz: I bought FSLR a few years ago due to its valuation and it has done very well for me. I trimmed back my holdings two weeks ago because it was a bit too weighty in my portfolio. Woe is me?
Comment by barfplanet: This post made me check the account that I own FSLR in. It's the account that I try to ignore, because if I don't look at it I make more money. 

I had no idea it gained like that. Thinking about selling some now, but that would break the "ignore the account" rule. Cost basis $33.

Comment by NightflowerFade: SolarEdge doesn't make solar panels so it's not exactly in the same segment as FSLR
Comment by FunctionAlone9580: I bought SEDG not too long ago. Not sure if I made the right move but I'm not selling. It's definitely dropped significantly since I bought it. Heard it was like the Toyota of solar panels though.¬†


Worried that Chinese products are going to take over the solar market in the US.¬†
Comment by Ordinary144: Seeing any Pineapple Energy installs?
Comment by None: depends on the time frame, probable that it can squeeze longer but there is the ATH only 14% away, and i'd personally never touch a stock close to its former ATH. There always a high risk it overshoots and rejects back down to form a cup and handle. Entry was at the break of yearly pivot at 178
Comment by Deadelevators: You‚Äôll need energy to power all that AI. I think that‚Äôs pretty obvious. And yes, my partner and child thank me for the $3mil USD I‚Äôve made so far in stocks.
Title : Curious on Energy Stocks
I‚Äôm new to energy stocks. The past few days, I‚Äôve noticed some stocks (that seem to be mostly solar) having some very nice upward movement. That said, looking at their history it seems like many of them are still very very low from their all time highs, possibly even close to their all time lows.

It‚Äôs difficult to track exact movement in the individual stocks and the sector in general. But with increasing energy demands, I‚Äôm very confused why solar stocks aren‚Äôt doing better. Their increase this week seems mostly fueled by Biden‚Äôs increase on tariffs of Chinese solar.

With energy being fundamental to fueling literally everything, why are so many solar stocks so low? Is that typical for the whole energy sector?

Sorry if this is considered low effort, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs individual solar stocks that are performing very well (only one I could see is FSLR), but I find it very bizarre that anything in the energy sector (especially renewables) are trending so low when they‚Äôre necessary to fuel everything done by the Mag 7.Comment by creemeeseason: For what its worth.... energy stocks usually refers to fossil fuels (oil, gas, and coal).

Solar usually falls under "technology"
Comment by Hoplite76: Traditional energy is doing fine. Renewables are struggling a bit. I think renewable energy is still a good investment but with a longer horizon.
Comment by JDinvestments: >why are so many solar stocks so low?

A better question is why should solar be valued any higher? 

Renewables are awful from an investment perspective without massive government subsidies. It's not an industry that can stand on its own in any viable way. See: Orsted, Siemens, and GE all losing billions on projects, cancelling whatever they can, and begging countries to renegotiate rates higher.

All that in mind, some of the best sources of revenue come when governments just hand out fistfuls of cash unchecked. So long as they continue to do so, the industry can stand.
Comment by BICRG: Ceg and vst. Look into those for energy.¬†
Comment by Imightbetohonestbuti: It‚Äôs because of the inflation reduction act.  I‚Äôd avoid solar personally.  There‚Äôs a reason these companies have good numbers but are still cheap
Comment by dvdmovie1: " I‚Äôm very confused why solar stocks aren‚Äôt doing better."

Because - in large part, there are other reasons - most solar companies are oriented mostly/entirely towards residential. As much as people may be for solar, for most households the decision to buy a solar set-up is a very discretionary one. It's also one that people generally take loans out for rather than buying outright. Ramp interest rates higher and you put a damper on demand quickly. 

Companies that focus more/entirely on commercial have done better - look at NXT. 

"I‚Äôve noticed some stocks (that seem to be mostly solar) having some very nice upward movement."

Solar has had periods of volatility in both directions before; the tariffs resulted in a good reaction for the stocks, but imo that doesn't offset demand being dampened by higher rates.

Problem is high rates, but also, if eventual rate cuts come because the economy is more visibly slowing, that isn't positive for demand, either. I don't think it'll happen but some discussion by some Fed governors the other day that another rate hike could be needed. If that actually happens, not a positive for residential solar.


The only solar stock I'd consider right now is NXT because that's working on the view of it being at least a partial beneficiary of data center energy demand. I own a number of utilities, a Canadian nat gas company and a few other assorted energy plays - the utilities have had a ridiculously good year - but no solar.
Comment by OutofTouchInTheWay: oil & gas midstream is a fave. pipelines, etc.  good divs.  buy on dips.
Comment by Winter-Pop-1881: Lol solar
Comment by bruhboxx: I'm interested in how to square the lack of investor confidence with the fact that 87% of new generating capacity installed in the US in Q1 2024 was Solar, including 99.7% in March. Natural Gas is nowhere to be seen in new installations.
Comment by myworkaccountduh: I can relate to this post a lot, as it sounds like me, when I began investing a decade ago.  It is not a popular opinion here, but since you're interested in energy, I'd consider looking into nuclear.  From an investment standpoint, you can find opportunities with uranium miners / refiners / developers / explorers / etc.  

Renewables such as wind / solar have a hard time providing baseload energy, unless paired with a large energy storage solution.  Hydro, while baseload, has a saturation point --- there are only so many viable water sources.  

Nuclear stands out to me, as it is baseload energy, which is also carbon free.  The other baseload energy sources (coal, natrual gas, oil) are all necessary, but emit carbon.  

There is also a fairly significant supply / demand discussion to be had surrounding uranium.  

Feel free to DM me if you have any questions / concerns / etc.  I've poured a lot of time into researching the sector, and would love to helpa  fellow investor.
Comment by chris_ut: Solar is a bad business and the companies often go bankrupt as soon as their subsidies dry up
Comment by notreallydeep: >With energy being fundamental to fueling literally everything, why are so many solar stocks so low?

With food being fundamental to fueling literally everyone, why are so many food companies so low?

Because some companies are good and some are bad. Usually many are bad and few are good. Solar specifically tends to predominantly be in the "bad" camp unless they can get subsidies, even more so in a high interest rate environment.
Comment by Hi-I-am-Toit: Traditional energy stocks are a concrete bastion standing on glass feet.

It‚Äôs under policy threat, social licence threat, black swan weather event threat, competing technology threats investor activism threat, and TCFD threat.

I wouldn‚Äôt hold any fossil stocks. I just don‚Äôt invest in high risk legacy industries. The crash, when it comes, will be brutal.
Comment by Hi-I-am-Toit: You just described fossil fuels. Renewables are readying their pockets for the subsidy switch-over, which is one-black-swan-weather-event-in-an-election-year away.
Comment by S-Nietzsche: I'm interested in ceg, but don't know why their free cashflow is negative, if you don't mind can you clue me in?
Comment by SoWhatNoZitiNow: Humor me, because I‚Äôm ignorant. How does the inflation reduction act play here and what is the reason these otherwise well-performing companies are still so cheap?
Comment by IllustriousBath5867: I agree
Comment by IllustriousBath5867: Solar financing relies on borrowing 
And rates are high etc
Comment by Hoplite76: I think you're over stated. Yes...it will come down but not for a couple of decades yet. You'll see it decline first in developed countries but the developing world will continue to use.

I uaed to think we were close to the tipping point but i no longer believe it. Until renewables are more reliable, it will stay an o&g dominated world

Title : First Solar jumps on strong quarter, record backlog
First Solar shares jumped Wednesday after reporting another solid quarter, with the company booked solid through 2026 and an order backlog that stretches into the end of the decade.

The stock traded as much as 9% higher on the day. It was last up about 2%.

Here‚Äôs how the company did in the fourth quarter:

Net income rose 30% year over year to $349.2 million from $268.3 million

Earnings per share of $3.25 beat an LSEG estimate of $3.13

Revenue of $1.15 billion was slightly below a consensus forecast of $1.31 billion

Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Percoco said the revenue miss was more than offset by strong margins of 43.3%, compared to consensus estimates of 37.7%.

First Solar has a record order backlog of 80.1 gigawatts stretching through the end of the decade with the company completely booked through the next two years.

First Solar is one of the few companies that has weathered the sharp downturn in the solar sector. While the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) has plummeted 43% over the past 12 months, First Solar is down 6.2% over the same period.

High interest rates pummeled the highly leveraged residential solar sector, but First Solar‚Äôs focus on large, utility-scale projects has insulated the company from the macroeconomic headwinds.

‚ÄúWe continue to believe FSLRs extended visibility into margin levels and cash flows provides a relative safe haven for investors,‚Äù JPMorgan analyst Mark Strouse told clients in a note. JPMorgan has a price target of $226 for the stock, implying about 56% upside from Tuesday‚Äôs close.

Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley raised their price targets on the back of First Solar‚Äôs quarterly report. Deutsche sees First Solar rising to 44% to $210 per share, while Morgan Stanley is expects upside of 69% to $245 per share.

‚ÄúThe company message is clear and loud - solid growth ahead, with increased capacity coming online and two new US facilities being built up,‚Äù Deutsche analyst Corinne Blanchard told clients Wednesday.

‚ÄúFSLR is utility exposed, and therefore we believe isolated from the current ongoing challenges for the rest of the solar space,‚Äù Blanchard wrote. ‚ÄúThe company also has a solid balance sheet, therefore reducing macro related headwinds.‚Äù

But there are potential headwinds on the horizon with bookings expected to slow after two bumper years. CFO Alexander Bradley told analysts on the company‚Äôs earnings call that First Solar will be ‚Äúhighly selective‚Äù with its contracting in 2024 as U.S. presidential and congressional elections later this year create uncertainty for the renewable sector.

Analysts are worried that Republicans might seek to weaken or repeal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act if they win unified control of government.

And CEO Mark Widmar told analysts that Chinese subsidization and dumping has led to a collapse in cell and module in key international markets such as India and Europe.

Goldman Sachs lowered its price target for First Solar to $265 from $275 prior despite the company‚Äôs strong quarter. The investment bank said solar module oversupply and potential changes to U.S. tax credits are key risks for First Solar moving forward.

Title : Top stocks for June 2023
Top U.S. stocks for June include First Solar Inc. ($FSLR), Nvidia Corp. ($NVDA), and Penumbra Inc. ($PEN). The share prices of all have more than doubled in the past year, as the Russell 3000, a capitalization-weighted stock market index used as a benchmark for the entire U.S. stock market, has returned 1%.  
  
Below, we list the top five stocks in each category: value, growth, and momentum. All data below is as of May 26.

# Best Value Stocks

Value investing is a factor-based investing strategy that involves picking stocks you believe are trading for less than what they are intrinsically worth, usually measured by the ratio of the stock‚Äôs price to one or more fundamental business metrics. A widely accepted value metric is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Value investors say that if a business is cheap compared with its intrinsic value (as measured by its P/E ratio, in this case), then the stock price may rise faster than others as the price comes back in line with the worth of the company. These are among the stocks with the lowest 12-month trailing P/E ratio.

# Best Value Stocks

**Southwestern Energy Co.**: An oil and natural gas explorer and producer with properties in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and Louisiana. In June 2022, the company authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program that can continue through the end of 2023. In the first quarter, Southwestern reported net income of $1.9 billion, swinging from a net loss of $2.7 billion in the year-ago quarter, and a 28% year-over-year revenue decline.

**Chesapeake Energy Corp.**: Chesapeake explores and develops oil and gas properties throughout the U.S. In February, Chesapeake Energy agreed to sell a portion of its Eagle Ford assets to global chemicals company INEOS for approximately $1.4 billion. In the first quarter of 2023, Chesapeake Energy's revenue nearly tripled from the year before and net income totaled $1.4 billion, or $9.60 a share.

**First Citizens BancShares Inc.**: This is a holding company that offers banking services such as deposit products, consumer loans, and commercial leases. First Citizens' net income surged in the most recent quarter after the lender acquired the assets and liabilities of Silicon Valley Bank at a steep discount.

**Ovintiv Inc.**: Ovintiv owns and operates various natural gas and oil properties in the U.S. and Canada. 

**DISH Network Corp.**: A TV service provider that offers programming packages, Sling TV, and wireless subscriber plans. On May 8, the company released its first-quarter earnings results. Net income fell 46%, and overall revenue declined by 9% compared with the same period in 2022. DISH lost over half a million Pay-TV subscribers in the first quarter, and its retail wireless segment posted a 9% reduction in subscribers compared with the previous year.

# Fastest-Growing Stocks

These are the top stocks as ranked by a growth model that scores companies based on a 50/50 weighting of their most recent quarterly year-on-year (YOY) percentage revenue growth and their most recent quarterly YOY earnings per share (EPS) growth.  
  
Both sales and earnings are critical factors in the success of a company. Therefore, ranking companies by only one growth metric makes a ranking susceptible to the accounting anomalies of that quarter (such as changes in tax law or restructuring costs) that may make one or the other figure unrepresentative of the business in general. Companies with quarterly EPS or revenue growth of more than 1,000% were excluded as outliers.

Momentum investing is a factor-based investing strategy that involves buying a stock whose price has risen faster than the market as a whole. Momentum investors believe that stocks that have outperformed the market will often continue to do so because the factors that caused them to outperform won't suddenly disappear. In addition, other investors seeking to benefit from the stock‚Äôs outperformance will often purchase it, further bidding up its price.

# These are the stocks that had the highest total return over the past 12 months.

**First Solar Inc.**: A solar energy company that makes cadmium telluride solar modules for commercial and industrial uses. Early this year, First Solar sold its 141 MW power plant located in Chile to the company Toesca for an undisclosed amount. On April 27, the company reported first-quarter earnings, with net sales declining by 45% to $548 million. Nonetheless, the company reported net income of $43 million, swinging to a profit from a $43 million loss in the year-ago quarter. The company's stock price rose by approximately 25% in the two weeks after earnings.

**NVIDIA Corp.**: This is a semiconductor company that derives most of its revenue from selling graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming PCs. On May 24, the company reported first-quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings. Nvidia reported 14% growth in data-center revenue and expanded artificial intelligence (AI) development with multiple partnerships and the introduction of AI Foundations, a generative AI language learning model. Following the earnings report, the company's share price rose by 24%, bringing it briefly to a $1 trillion market cap.

**Penumbra Inc.**: Penumbra develops and sells minimally invasive medical devices that help remove blood clots from the body.

**Netflix Inc.**: An entertainment streaming company that offers a wide range of original and licensed movies and TV shows.

**Axon Enterprise Inc.**: Axon manufactures and sells conducted-energy weapons under the Taser brand, and cloud-based video equipment and software for use by law enforcement. Axon has experienced steady growth over the past year. Axon's YOY revenue jumped 34% in the first quarter on the release of multiple new products and 51% growth in cloud sales.

# Top-Stock Investing Advantages

To become a top stock, a company most likely produces positive trends in its earnings, revenue, and share price. Momentum in these areas indicates a well-run business that has the potential to keep generating profit and creating shareholder value.  
  
Investors can use free stock-screening sites like Finviz to find top stocks, filtering by both fundamental and technical metrics. For example, a trader could find a top stock by scanning for companies that are trading at a new 52-week high or that have reported higher earnings consistently over the past five years.

# Liquidity

Top stocks typically receive extensive media coverage and are followed by leading Wall Street analysts. This usually means more liquidity, leading to better prices and faster trade executions. Moreover, top stocks with ample liquidity are more difficult for larger players to manipulate, helping to keep a fair and orderly market in them.

# Top-Stock Investing Risks

**Missed Opportunities**  
Investing only in top large-cap stocks means that investors may miss profitable opportunities in other areas of the stock market. Some of the most significant gains come from small-cap stocks under the radar. For example, an unknown small biotechnology company may announce a breakthrough discovery that propels its share price higher. Even if investors favor trading top stocks, allocating a portion of capital to other stock groups helps avoid missing compelling opportunities.  
  
**Trend Reversals**  
The trend is your friend‚Äîuntil it's not. Even top large-cap stocks with a track record of earnings growth and creating shareholder value encounter unforeseen challenges. For example, cruise line companies, such as Carnival Corp. (CCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH), reported increased revenue in the years leading up to the pandemic but watched their top line sink to unprecedented lows for several years due to no-sail orders and a collapse in passenger demand during the worldwide health crisis.  
  
When investing in top stocks, investors should always use a stop-loss order to protect against sudden trend reversals.Comment by gonebymidnite: have you checked the price to earnings ratio of First Solar? its 499.17‚Ä¶. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_down)
Comment by InvisibleEar: Dish isn't a value stock lol, they're toast. The future is nobody paying for cable and satellite.
Comment by quintupletuna: Down with penumbra. Products are Heavily used in my world of neurosurgical vascular intervention.
Comment by icanflywheniwant: Actually FSLR is a great stock as they're poised to earn billions of dollars in tax credits in the coming year or so due to the IFRA. Also their PE ratio is a bit distorted due to the penalty they had to pay for demurrage or something last year. So both last year and TTM would be distorted due to this one time expense that is just not going to happen in the future. 

I am currently not invested in the stock as I do expect a small pullback in the general markets and hopefully I will be getting a better price on this.
Comment by Tricky-Blue: also worth mentioning C3 dot ai imo, and ISRG (a robotic surgery company) maybe too  
i get some nice picks from realvision.com (they like roku, zoom, sq) and thebrrr.com
