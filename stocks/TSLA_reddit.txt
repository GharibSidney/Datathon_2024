Title : RDDT - pump & dump territory? 
I posted about reddit stock a few weeks ago with a general mindset while it was in the 70s its potentially undervalued, but since their earnings report 2 days ago this went from 84 to current 120s and rising. 

While I believe longer term it's possible for them to grow more into the valuation wallstreet is pumping on the ticker, it's up 45% in a day and a half.

Its the nature of the beast sometimes for a stock to uncontrollably run up. It's rare a stock stays up that high. Only exception to the rule is something like tsla stock.

Is anyone buying post earnings in the triple digits? If so, what's your target or are you just chasing/fomoing into this ticker?Comment by Moaning-Squirtle: I bought Reddit when it was last around $50. I'll be leaving it there to do whatever it wants, but I won't be buying more.
Comment by Yield_On_Cost: All i am going to say is that Reddit's value is very vague, nobody can really pinpoint how much it is worth, that's the main reason behind the extreme volatility. I am staying away personally, feels more like gambling than investing.
Comment by Uniflite707: This is not a pump and dump, this is Wall Street scrambling to correctly revalue a company it didn’t understand. It had been looked down upon for so long for remaining unprofitable for so long but now that’s changed.

Also, some other things have changed over the past few years. Its user base has massively increased. It’s name recognition has massively increased (I find seniors know what it is and so do teens and everyone in between). The AI deals and Google partnership have happened which are huge. The public is apparently adding the word “Reddit“ to its Google searches to such an extent that now all Google search results include segregated Reddit results. Why is this? It’s because the value of decades of crowdsourced opinions aggregated and organized by every conceivable interest turns out to be an extremely valuable resource, and people are now recognizing that on a mass scale. Reddit is also apparently attracting large numbers of users who shun other social media platforms…I’m one of them.

Reddit is proving to be an Internet company that was there from close to the beginning but never had everything come together until recently. Very unusual situation.
Comment by LankyComfortable4693: Stocks like RDDT can definitely become pump-and-dump targets when they see a sudden surge like this, especially post-earnings. That 45% jump is huge, and it makes sense that people are wary.

For me, if I were considering buying in, I’d set a clear target price and exit strategy – easier said than done, but it helps avoid FOMO-driven decisions. What are others here thinking? Do you see this as a long-term hold, or are we looking at short-term gains before it dips back?
Comment by ColdBostonPerson77: Reddit killed earnings.  I bought 1k shares at 80 each.  I expect this to go 200 a share within a year. Long term hold. 

Reddit is the go to place now too.  Gardening? Check. Home remodel? Check.  Refurbishing? Check.  Review on random tv show? Got that too. 

There’s legit a sub for anything you can think of and active users. 

When I Google anything I want an opinion on, I add reddit to the search.  

That’s why I went so deep on shares before earnings.
Comment by xFblthpx: Compare their current valuation to Pinterest and Snapchat and the valuation makes sense at a 20B market cap.
Comment by Shermshank: I bought 100 shares of Reddit based on my brother-in-law‘s comment that his friend works there and he loves it. It had just been IPO ed. when a stock is up over 40% in one day that’s pretty rarefied air. I decided to sell it. I’ll probably regret it, but I’m trying not to be emotional aka fomo
Comment by Capster11: Pump and dump companies don’t beat on every single important metric and raise guidance. When they decided to go public, the company started taking making money very seriously. Reddit will continue to grab investor interest over the long term because it is the only platform to provide data/content/interest on every topic imaginable. Yes, the stock can drop in the short term esp if the overall market gets punished but it will be home run long term.
Comment by PeachyCarnehand: Legitimate question- do you have any valuation thesis ? Because a beat in earnings and sales usually means that forward projections are adjusted and reflect much larger numbers based upon much larger compounded growth rates. So the answer to your question of whether it is being pumped due to meaningless momentum versus a sustainable re-rating lies here
Comment by Responsible-Skirt-90: I def fomo’d. I’m new to all this but I guess being an active Reddit user made it easier for. Also knew when I bought it was for the long term which made it easier for me to
Comment by SpongEWorTHiebOb: RDDT is the new AI play. Bloomberg is reporting that they are selling data to all the LLM players to train their AI models. It makes sense. No one thought they would be profitable this quickly. However, this revenue stream may disappear in a few quarters. MSFT, META and the rest are getting blowback on their AI and capex spend.
Comment by ptjunkie: Not just yet. But soon^tm
Comment by lambusdean77: i agree there is some long term value, but what we are seeing now is probably post-earnings hype. i sold mine at around $90, and expect that RDDT will have more bad days like all tech stocks do, at which point i will probably buy and hold longer
Comment by FireHamilton: How is it vague? They are a profitable company.
Comment by ball0fsnow: Their EPS was 0.59 for the quarter I think? So in a flat scenario that’s 2.40 per year. Trading at 120 would be 50 PE. Flat scenario is unlikely given their growth rate. 50 PE for a stock growing at 60 odd percent in revenue year over year is actually fairly reasonable. Margins also look very good so most of that rev growth goes straight to the bottom line. If they keep growing revenue by that much you could be looking at net income of over 1bn in 2026, at today’s valuation that’s sub 20 PE. If their growth rate maintains beyond that point you’re looking at valuations much higher than 20bn. Lots of ifs I. There but to me that scenario isn’t out of the question.
Comment by PreventerWind: Reddit's value I do agree can be quite vague.  But everyone seems to not mention that they have the largest social media platform and can (and probably are) collecting a ton of data on us.
Comment by Cobainism: Reddit is rapidly growing in popularity in India, with 900 million Internet users. It will have a 50B market cap.
Comment by Curious_Bytes: I agree with this completely. I think the real question is what is a reasonable value/price? My basis is around 70. What price levels should we be buyers at now? 

Personally, I think this is a very difficult question. Because it’s unclear whether Reddit is going to be the next meta/goog or just another pins. There is a wide dispersion of possible outcomes for rddt and as such, taking some concept of the expected value is unsatisfying. You’ll likely either be way under valued or way over valued. Right now I lean towards adding on pullbacks materially below pins type of market cap while monitoring earnings and ad monetization. To become the next meta they’ll need to really crank the ad monetization and that will show up in a continually increasing earnings levels.
Comment by kkInkr: Wasn't it a shot squeeze?
Comment by Solidplum101: I personally think there will be a 20% retrace. Most likely 95-100 is a good place to purchase. That's purely on a technical basis. 

Long term i wanna say we can see this run up much higher as long as they prove they can monetize and continue to make $$
Comment by cache_me_0utside: I don't think that's a good reason to invest. They've always been a source of organic data. It's basically content for google. The better question is are they effectively monetizing without damaging the site?
Comment by Uniflite707: Agree in a broad sense but when you compare the market cap to both of those I think Reddit justifies a higher valuation. Reddit is hitting critical mass (finally) and has much more potential for growth internationally than those other two.
Comment by bighand1: AI revenue is less than 9% of its total revenue with no signs of near term growth. 

Earning beat like this would further causes ads revenue to accelerate as more companies come and check out what's the fuss
Comment by slimkay: I think that’s the right take. However their EPS was 0.16 for the quarter.
Comment by IceEateer: This is a good take.  It's wasted on this thread though, because the bearish post just wants to hear reinforcing takes to support their bear position.
Comment by Yield_On_Cost: I feel like the users data is pretty much worthless given the anonymity factor. The main selling point is the knowledge of users, which makes it the most unique social media platform out there.

Any time i have a issue, usually a tech one, i always end up on Reddit and the top comment is a guy explaining every single detail and how to solve it step by step. So i feel there is a lot of value in this platform.

How much value can be realistically extracted from this? I don't think anyone knows at this point in time.
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: Isn’t Facebook larger?
Comment by Yield_On_Cost: How did you end up with the $50B value? Based on what?
Comment by LankyComfortable4693: That makes sense, especially with a potential retrace to the 95-100 range. I agree – if they can really nail down a strong monetization strategy, this could have solid long-term potential. It’s always a gamble with these kinds of stocks, but having a plan helps. Are you thinking of scaling in at those lower levels, or just watching to see how it plays out?
Comment by ColdBostonPerson77: They appear to be.  They beat earnings and you better believe they’re going to monetize the data 100 different ways.  

They also have an army of free workers (moderators), which helps.   The day I quit using Reddit will be when I divest it from my port.  

The old rule: buy what you use. I wish I followed it my entire life (nvidia, amd, Facebook, Brcm,  etc). I use Reddit a lot lol.  Long hold.
Comment by wm313: While yes, they are a content for Google, I got sucked into Reddit from a Google search years ago. I see it as people see AI stocks. You can be in stocks attached to AI that aren't AI specific. Reddit has driven lots of engagement, and that seems to be the name of the game. Once they nail down advertising it will expand their revenue tremendously. I'm not a holder of RDDT but it's so tempting.
Comment by xFblthpx: Agreed.
Comment by ball0fsnow: Yeah I actually think I was looking at the pre stock compensation number. Still think it stands mostly true
Comment by ball0fsnow: Yeah it’s mostly about anecdotal feelings here. Nobody does any maths
Comment by tirobasura: Advertisers don’t need to know who you are to market to you. They only need their advertisements to show up on your screen based on what they know you like or think you might need, which Reddit knows or can infer based on your activity.
Comment by Front_Expression_892: This conversation is going to be used to train chatgpt
Comment by wm313: It's anonymous to you and I, the user, but not so much to them. They are collecting data on us regardless. They have your search history and they have your email. They don't need to know who you are in particular. They just need access to your devices, which they have.
Comment by IXVIVI: But they know a lot about a particular group of user. 

For example, if you are a brand and you wanted to know more about your user baser. You could scan through people's post and comments to identify which users uses your products. Then look at these user's habbits (like what sub they usually goto) and try to profile them.
Comment by xFblthpx: Yes, but it’s ok because no one in this post is informed. Reddit also has already sold data to google and OpenAI in publicly disclosed multimillion dollar deals. It’s not speculation. All of the people on this post that are calling rddt a pump and dump have never once read any of the quarterlies, and are just in disbelief that their moralizations of the facts are holding up to reality.
Comment by Cobainism: It's literally used as Google. Still has room to implement revenue generating features within the app and monetize AI partnerships for the sheer amount of genuine user interaction across various topics and activities. 

Right now it's at 20B after Wall Street incorrectly underestimated it for months. Even after the initial post-earnings rally, it also increased from 102 to 120 the day after. And again, the rapid growth in Indian users.
Comment by Solidplum101: Great question :-) I wanted to hold for a long time but I have a rule if a stock runs up higher than 20% in a day i   evaluate and if it goes up 40% i really need to think.

I sold some after the earnings pop then I sold the rest when it tapped 119. 

My average cost was 58 bucks. I'm a big believer in this one long term and it sucks to get taxed from selling... but I wanted to lock in profits.

How about you? Are you in?
Comment by Acceptable_Candy1538: Not that anecdotal experience matters much, but my company had about $30k in weekly ad spend for internet marketing. 

The best ROI by platform for us is instagram followed by Reddit. And I’m not talking about impressions, I’m talking about real clickthrough sales
Comment by cache_me_0utside: I'm not convinced the shitty ads is going to be a positive long term trade off. The content and platform has clearly suffered IMO, as I can remember the site from 10+ years ago.
Comment by cache_me_0utside: > Reddit has driven lots of engagement

As far as I can tell, they may have increased numbers but the actual quality of content has gone way down. The amount of reposts and bots is enormous compared to the past. A lot of the content that you see on google is old. As time goes on I suspect the decreased quality will increasingly cause issues. Also it is telling the only proper way to STILL search reddit is to use google and it's quite incomplete and primitive. 

> Once they nail down advertising

they're working on it but I personally don't like the transformation they've been forcing into the site.
Comment by Yield_On_Cost: Still. Why $50B? Why not $35B? Why not $75B? Why not $100B?


What is the basis of this valuation?
Comment by wm313: Believers don't sell.
Comment by wm313: I realize the bots are highly active. It's pretty annoying, and others seem to notice as well from the posts I see. As for advertising, it's a necessary evil. It's the only way they're really going to monetize and see revenue. Just a copy of Meta. I just scroll past them, but I can see how it could be effective. I bought some shirts on FB because they fit my style. Wouldn't have discovered them on my own, so it can work as long as the person isn't getting caught up in a spending spree. As for the other repetitive ads like Blue Chew and the easy meal kits, and other irrelevant ads, yea I hate those.
Comment by Cobainism: Ok it could be more lmao. Awesome if that’s the case. My main point is that it’s still undervalued at 20B. 
Comment by cache_me_0utside: > yea I hate those.

I don't see them because I use ad blockers and don't browse reddit in a way that would leak them through. The few times I've seen what 2024 reddit looks like without old.reddit.com/r/*, RES, and adblockers is horrific. Again, just IMO. I also don't know that the obvious quality decline in pursuit of money is a reason to not buy the stock. I've actually been thinking that the selling out the userbase for money is perhaps a strong buy signal until a real competitor rises up to steal the user generated content.
Title : Clean energy
Do we think it’s overvalued or undervalued or somewhere in between? There’s lots of variance in clean energy stocks for example, TSLA could be considered clean energy but so can NEE. 

I sold some lame duck clean energy stocks in 2021 in order to tax loss harvest but i’ve been interested in NEE as of late but not sure how long i’d end up holding to see profit. Is this a 10 year endeavor? 20+? I feel like we’ve all been talking about clean energy for the last 15 years but still hardly any movement on it. Comment by alecjperkins213: I've been holding PBW

C'mon in.. the water's fine..
Comment by Adventurous-Tough553: Normally, I don't like to factor politics into investing, but the clean energy trade seems to depend on the outcome of the presidential election, at least for the next 20 months.....
Comment by AngryGigantopithecus: RYCEY. 

Nuclear stocks are the future. Not solar. With all the data centers needed for AI, nuclear power is needed to constantly power these data centers. 

I’m still bullish on Solar. Battery Packs can help in cases of electricity saving or in the event of a black out.
Comment by SunkDestroyer: I think that certain sectors in the green energy market have massive upside in the next 20 years (ie. Nuclear, SMR's, Solar and Wind). The world ^((Europe especially)) has realised that we critically need energy independence. China has been going full steam on that front and the rest of the world is trying to catch up. Will be an interesting couple of years.
Comment by Much_Dealer8865: I would only buy nuclear stocks as I believe other forms have too many downsides. I don't know which nuclear company will do well but for uranium/precious metals Cameco, Wheaton and NexGen are popular.
Comment by Corpulos: URNM. Invest in the material itself.
Comment by iqisoverrated: Not sure what to suggest to buy (I'm heavily in TESLA but at this point buying is a gamble because it's already so high. It might go up but it also might go down. Do your own research) 

...but I would disagree with the nuclear-bros in this thread. Nuclear is just not cost competitive compared to solar and wind firmed with storage. Even the SMR companies *that haven't even built anything yet* can't claim - with a straight face - that they will be cost competitive under the most optimal of outcomes. 

Non-SMR nuclear projects are always vastly over budget and timeline. This has little to do with nuclear but with the nature of megaprojects. But it results in the same thing: The power out of these projects isn't cost competitive.  (And we don't even know yet whether SMR will have this issues...which would hit their profitability a lot harder)

Apart from that: the timeline until a changeover has to be completed is far too tight to give nuclear a chance to contribute significantly.
Comment by AimlesslyCheesy: What does everyone think of URA?
Comment by HispanicExmuslim: OKLO baby!!
Comment by PositionFearless8502: FLNC, TSLA, NEE are all great picks.
Comment by meowmeowmrcow: I think there is a dearth of good, publicly-traded clean energy companies. Manufacturing of clean energy infrastructure is largely commoditized. Many owners of clean energy generation are not publicly traded companies. Nuclear might be investable but the trend isn’t even clear imo much less figuring out which company would come out on top. I’m admittedly not super knowledgeable in the space.

So while the trend over the next 20 years is undeniable, it’s going to be a tough play unless you know the industry very well and can find some diamonds in the rough. 

As much as I hate to say it, owning electric utilities is probably not a bad play given the expected load growth and commitment to clean energy transition.
Comment by PositiveKarma1: Solar energy is on a flat line ( no room anymore to invent something with a half of the price, half of weight and double energy production....as the last improvements in solar panels succeeded to raise productivity with less than 10% and they bring a new generation each 1-2 years), nuclear energy is going down as a nuclear plants needs 16 years to recover the costs and now they found how expensive is to decommission a reactor and no money saved enough for, compared with solar plants that need 5 years to recover the investments or wind turbines that need 4-6 years.

But personally I would not invest in energy industry at all. There are industries more dynamic with bigger ROI, and even ETFs SP500 are better performing than anything in energy.
Comment by meowmeowmrcow: How so?
Comment by HispanicExmuslim: Why Rycey over OKLO?
Comment by slimkay: It’s one thing for the green energy markets to have upside, it’s another for companies operating in said markets to be viable investments.

Looking at the performance of wind / solar -related stocks doesn’t paint a very rosy picture.
Comment by upperflapjack: I've been thinking the same thing about China
Comment by Adventurous-Tough553: I cashed in my 80% gain on OKLO today. Foolish? Smart? Impossible to know. I believe in nuclear, but OKLO is totally unproven, so I figured I'd take the gain.
Comment by Adventurous-Tough553: Seriously? Go read about how one candidate have vowed to stop the green scam spending, stop EVs on day one, get rid of solar subsidies, eliminate the part of the government that supports clean energy projects, and has attacked wind power in all forms-- while cutting all regulations to make non-clean energy cheaper.
Comment by U_slut: Maybe because they have a working reactor? Oklo is a pre revenue, pre prototype meme stock.
Comment by meowmeowmrcow: And this is why you shouldn’t invest in industries you aren’t an expert in…

EV subsidies are the only thing Trump is likely to be able to touch, and even that may be questionable now with Elon gobbling his schlong.

Most policy experts in the space don’t think there is any way in hell the IRA gets rolled back and that houses the major solar/wind/nuke subsidies. 

A Harris administration may provide some addl tailwinds, although unlikely at this point. So in general, I just don’t think you’re correct, although happy to discuss regarding a specific company as I’m sure there are corner cases.
Comment by Outrageous-Care-6488: Clean energy will never take off. Clean coal/ carbon capture is the future. Long $OXY
Comment by HispanicExmuslim: Sorry, U slut, new to trading. Trying to figure out what nuclear to invest in
Comment by Adventurous-Tough553: It sounds like you are talking about being an expert on politics and limits of presidential power, not being an expert on an industry. I stand by my statement that the political situation adds extra risk to the clean energy industry and stocks for the next 20 months and think it is well-supported. Is it a 100% extra risk, no. But, it is substantial. As an investor, why not wait a month before making any more clean energy investments? Cheerio.
Comment by Shermshank: A serious subject, but what a great response, lol at the schlong comment.
Comment by meowmeowmrcow: Fair enough, I didn’t mean to be a dick. 

I simply meant that as someone who works in clean energy and interacts with regulatory/political experts to understand exactly these sorts of risks, I think the risk you are stating is way overblown. Just my perspective. As I said in another comment, I don’t think the clean energy space is set up well for retail investors to take advantage of anyway so all kind of a moot point. Just interesting to observe staunchly held beliefs in an industry I believe I know quite well. That said, clean energy is a big category and I certainly don’t know all of it well.
Comment by Adventurous-Tough553: Perhaps I'm paranoid but I think the one candidate is simply un-predictable. And, will there be a political sweep? Also, he has a history of blocking things he doesn't not like by refusing to fund departments/appoint necessary people, shutting down things supposedly outside presidential power-- not supposed to be able to block but tricky tricks. Since there is talk of lots of large scale, dramatic action planned-- and his not being a fan of clean energy-- it makes me nervous investing in the area. But, I agree with you that there are some excellent clean energy stocks in general.
Title : Tesla shares jump 6% on profit beat
* Tesla reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analysts’ estimates even as revenue came in just shy of expectations.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $25.18 billion vs. $25.37 billion expected

Revenue increased 8% in the quarter from $23.35 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.85 billion, or 53 cents s share, a year ago.

Tesla’s profit margins were bolstered by $739 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue during the quarter. The company has also been offering an array of discounts and incentives to spur sales.

Automotive revenue increased 2% to $20 billion from $19.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue soared 52% to $2.38 billion, while services and other revenue jumped 29% to $2.79 billion.

Operating margin was reported at 10.8% of sales to improve from last quarter's mark of 6.3%, and top last year's mark of 7.6%. Total GAAP gross margin was 19.8% vs. 17.9% a year ago and 18.0% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.67 billion vs. $3.76 billion a year ago. For the quarter, the EV juggernaut's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 18.5% of sales from 16.1% a year ago.

# 

Tesla had already disclosed 462,890 deliveries for Q3. The electric vehicle maker said it produced 469,796 vehicles during the quarter. Tesla noted that 3% of the deliveries were subject to operating lease accounting. For reference, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in Q2 of this year and 435,059 vehicles in Q3 of last year. Tesla's  all-time deliveries record was 484,507 vehicles in Q4 of 2023. Looking ahead, Tesla reiterated that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.

# More than just EVs

Tesla said energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q3 to a record 6.9 GWh, but were up 75% Y/Y. Overall, Tesla said energy services and other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of the company. "As energy storage products continue to ramp, and our vehicle fleet continues to grow, we are expecting continued profit growth from these businesses over time," noted TSLA. The company also said that it deployed and is training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at Gigafactory Texas, where it expects to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October.

# Balance sheet

Tesla ended the quarter with a cash position of $33.6 billion. The sequential increase of $2.9 billion was a result of positive free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.3 billion during the quarter.

**SUMMARY**

We delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year-on-year, resulting in record third-quarter volumes. We also recognized our second-highest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements.

Our cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle came down to its lowest level ever at \~$35,100. In order to continue accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, we need to make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles – including more affordable models – which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025. At our "We, Robot" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car ownership, and even public transit.

The Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin. Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3.

Despite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.Comment by Rabbit_Say_Meow: Genuinely, I am shocked.

A reminder to everyone that Reddit is an echo chamber that will ALWAYS value polarizing opinions over anything else. Do your own research!
Comment by InsaneGambler: RIP for the smart people that buy puts due to their "technical analysis" (personal bias).
Comment by rotutu8: Here for the Reddit meltdown
Comment by DOE_ZELF_NORMAAL: Volumes is one thing, but I'm mostly impressed by the gross margins considering this is the biggest issue in the market right now. Most car manufacturers are struggling to make any margins while Tesla is increasing their margins while dropping prices. They even managed to get positive margins on the CT while still in the ramp up phase, which is crazy considering the (negative) margins on competitors EV trucks.

If they can keep this up, they are the only western car manufacturer right now whose able to compete with China on EVs and the volumes/market share will follow.
Comment by Specialist-Routine86: Great quarter, did not expect that, Impressive performance on COGS, Megapack and Tesla energy gross margin, as well as Service/Other.

another great quarter for the energy business from a business that is "just a car company"....
Comment by callmecrude: Just more validation as to why the average redditor spends their life underperforming the market. The amount of clueless and emotional bearish posts I see about Tesla on here every day is astounding. Even in this comment section there’s already people sputtering nonsense about “just wait the stock will still crater. Elon is cooking the books like Enron hur dur.” It’s lunacy at its finest.

For any eCommerce ventures looking to keep pace with such dynamic markets, tools like Intelis could be a game-changer in optimizing your pricing strategy on platforms like Google Shopping. Success in these sectors often comes down to smart pricing decisions, and every edge counts!
Comment by sadus671: If you look at the investors slides.... A lot of the increase came from operational income (aka software accessory sales). 

This came from the foundation edition CyberTrucks. Since the 20k mark up is counted as operational income.

Now that they are transitioning from Foundation Editions to normal Editions of the Cybertruck...this is going to completely evaporate in Q4...

So.... Watch out for Guidance during the Earnings Call....
Comment by NotTakenGreatName: I made a decision long ago to stay away from trying to play this stock long or short and I feel really good about it.
Comment by tanrgith: Happy shareholder here

Was totally expecting a dumpster fire of a quarter, so to see the exact opposite is great. 

This is also why I don't try to time stocks lol, just buy good shit and hold on through the ups and downs
Comment by Sandvicheater: All the Elon haters here have told repeatedly multiple times to not let personal politics affect your investment judgement and now we're seeing a meltdown of all these alt-left redditors who bet the farm on puts blowing up their portfolio.
Comment by ContentExamination19: Bought 50 shares today morning 🥳🥳
Comment by AlwaysATM: Wtf this is a surprise. Pretty shit earnings still excluding credit. Still went up like crazy

Comment by Karlkootkax: Will I be shocked if the stock goes down tomorrow? Can't say 🤣 but holding my puts a little longer.
Comment by SmokinJunipers: Not a single analysis on Elons tweets, poor explanation.
Comment by MrMeseekssss: Tesla down 4% year to date VOO up 22%. Think about that...
Comment by Sure-Protection5720: my calls will pay and that means more donations to Kamala Harris when I sell tomorrow. holding 350 calls. amazing. I don't like Elon but still makes money off him. same with DJT. Harris 2024.
Comment by Btomesch: They used to love Elon til he got political. This being a left leaning social platform, all the hate makes sense.
Comment by lakeoceanpond: **rubbing nipples**

Update: up 18%, my girl letting me rub her nipples now too
Comment by icaranumbioxy: Sounds like Tesla is doing very well despite Reddit sentiment/bots saying otherwise. This has been the same story since 2015. Media says Tesla is struggling....they kept improving.
Comment by 5_1_2021: Sorry if this is a stupid question, but how was their expected earnings per share lower than reported, yet expected revenue higher than reported? I read something abt gaap but still dont understand

Comment by altimas: But, Reddit told me nobody is buying after Elmo's shenanigans
Comment by flyingistheshiz: People got too caught up nursing their Elon/Tesla hate boners and missed the obvious signs.  Tesla is killing it, FSD is truly groundbreaking tech on a scale we have not seen, and they are acing the charging infrastructure game.  Meanwhile Waymo demonstrations still involved a driver hovering the wheel like their lives depend on it, yet Wall Street misinformation experts would have you believe Tesla is somehow not at the forefront of self driving.

Wild.  I continue to profit off this stock wondering why people can't see what I see, but ultimately not caring because I'm here to make myself money- not make strangers money.  People got caught sleeping.

Comment by Working-Message4504: Kamala bros. in shambles, I’m lovin it!
Comment by luv2block: Musk is too unethical for me to believe any of Tesla's numbers anymore. I'm not smart enough to know if they are cooking the books or not. Some say they are, some say they aren't, but I don't know. 

I do know he presented robots as though they were autonomous, when in reality they were controlled by humans remotely. 
I really think he's got no problem outright lying about anything.

Comment by CubanlinkEnJ: Fuck Tesla
Comment by thejumpingsheep2: No material rev growth since late 2022 and net inflated by regulatory credits. This was not a good report. Seems to me that their car business has reached its peak and is declining.

Growth in other stuff is good but how profitable is that stuff? Whats the margin on it?

Comment by reddit-abcde: I wish I listened to Belfort and bought more
Comment by Spankynpetey: Smoke and mirrors. What will a Tesla be in 10-20 years? Disposable cars. Good hype job by Elon though. Without reg credits this quarter is not so impressive.

Stop letting price movements inform you, thats what suckers do
Comment by discoveringnature12: 😄. yeah. I see so much negativity on reddit man. people just want to thrash corporations left and right without any rational sometimes. 

Tesla is polarizing of course, people have strong opinions about it.  

Not a TSLA stock holder
Comment by upL8N8: Tesla's net income is down 32% y/y through the first three quarters of the year.  Not good.

Their original guidance was 50% CAGR from 2020 - 2030.  They were above 50% through 2023.  Through 2024, their CAGR looks like it'll be dropping to around 38%.  If they maintain a similar unit sales volume in 2025, it'll drop to 30%.  Not good.

Tesla has a forward PE of over 72 right now, which will be even higher tomorrow.  Other OEMs, who have performed far better than Tesla recently, are sitting around forward PEs of 5-7.  Tesla's valuation heavily relies on the idea of constant future growth.

Their robotaxi event was generally scoffed at.  Not good.

It was fairly expected they'd beat estimates, and given how shit the stock has been lately, that often leads to a short term pump.  I could see a 61.8% retracement by the end of the month from wherever its high is over the next 1-2 days (probably right around 240, dropping to 222).  Then I imagine it'll pop back up to a lower high around 250-255.  Then, it's likely all down from there, likely back down to around the 160-175 area by beginning of next year... lining up with quarterly sales figures which I don't expect to be spectacular.  Maybe it beats last year, but that isn't saying much when they were previously claiming a 50% CAGR.

Why this stock is worth so much more than other auto OEMs is probably a question a lot of major investors are asking themselves.  A lot of them were betting on autonomous taxis... but Musk can only claim it's 1-2 years away for so long before they eventually start to wise up.  (10 years... he's been claiming that every year for 10 years straight now)

The stock's a dog, Meme investors just don't know it yet.  It's been in a long term downward trend, no doubt supported by a core of buy and hold forever insiders and cultists, and of course S&P index funds that will only sell if everyone else does.

Hell, GM is outperforming it...

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Imagine where this company would be if they weren't pulling in $10+ billion in government subsidies and regulatory credit sales every year...
Comment by chat_gre: FWIW, My next car is not going to be a Tesla. Many people like me in California bought teslas before Elon become the crazy lunatic he is now. For better or worse, he is the face of Tesla and I for one will not finance that.
Comment by WorstCPANA: I'm seeing people on main subreddits get upvoted for saying Tesla has only sold 30 cybertrucks. People eat it up because they hate elon here.

Comment by flareyeppers: To be fair even with this 12% bump tesla is still down for the year while spy is up 20% for the year.
Comment by iqisoverrated: Margins are great (especially in the energy sector...30%...that's *massive*!)...Though I expect the margins in the auto sector to come down again next quarter since the boost from the Cybetruck founder series is now over. But if they can hold at around 15% there then that'd perfectly fine for me.
Comment by Flipslips: Tesla Energy has been killing it.

30% margins. Maxed out production at their current factory and their new factory will be online soon. Absolutely skyrocketing growth

Comment by HelloYesThisIsFemale: Lmao probably coping due to their poor ESG fund performance.
Comment by Init_4_the_downvotes: Everyone should have a bear and bull thesis on a stock they buy. Right now my bear thesis is even though tons of growth is already baked into earnings there are institutions dollar cost averaging and people buying the stock off good news to sell option contracts to people gamboling trump wins the election hoping his connections with Elon will allow for forced scalability backed by government money. If I start seeing a massive influx of option trading in the next several months I'm going to think this bump is temporary and that a new ramp rugpull cycle is here.

Comment by tech01x: 70 FWD P/E according to Yahoo Finance, but here's the thing... that's based on a collection of analyst estimates and we know that those are trash. So why would you depend on that number?

Trailing P/E is 60 and they will be growing next year and the following year and have a sizable command of the BEV market, which will grow to overtake most of the automotive market.
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: And that won't change unless big investors become convinced that Tesla's AI efforts have failed.

Comment by THIESN123: RemindMe! 5 years

Comment by TimeTravelingChris: Except their sales are down Q4 will be even worse.

Comment by seekfitness: Believe it or not, but most people don’t consider politics when purchasing products.
Comment by pepsirichard62: Someone’s grumpy
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: Plenty of people don't care about the politics. 

The issue is that the politics pushes a certain % of potential customers away, which negatively affects the supply/demand dynamic. 

If a company makes 50 units of a product and there are 100 interested buyers, the company can generally sell its products at higher price and profitability than if there were only 80 potential buyers. 

The question isn't whether Tesla can sell its products.  They can.  The question is: at what price they can sell those products?

I think it's likely that Tesla's automotive margins would be higher if Mr. Musk wasn't alienating potential customers.  Fewer $ competing to buy product places pressure on profit margin
Comment by TIectric: Saying Elon denies climate change shows you have literally no idea what you're talking about.

As opposed to paying the same for a shitty Toyota Aygo or €10K a year for a decent ICE vehicle.

Comment by shwaynebrady: 
Idk how people haven’t realized how absolutely detached the market is from reality and fundamentals. This earnings report in no way shape or form justifies a 700B market cap and 60+ P/E ratio. But seeing as Tesla as a 40%+ retail investor and 13% with musk himself, and reading the comments on this post and the ones like it. It doesn’t surprise me that the stock is where it’s at.
Comment by HelloYesThisIsFemale: First stage of grief I see
Comment by lakeoceanpond: Even Carson Block won’t short Tesla.
Comment by Flipslips: Even without the credits they would still make a profit. The credits are essentially just another product for them. Why is that a bad thing?
Comment by throwmeneck: Are people supposed to only buy stocks at ATHs or something?
Comment by Dread_Pirate_Chris: Market performance does not necessarily relate to company performance, and Tesla has a long history of underperforming while people disbelieve their technology and then surging when they actually produce product. 

Wall street in general is skeptical of anything that doesn't have a track record in the financials. Elon Musk's tendency to be make drastically overoptimistic estimates on timelines doesn't help. 

None of that however has anything to do with whether or not they will be a leading EV manufacturer, solve the FSD problem, or produce useful humanoid robots. 

If you think they will succeed on any of those fronts, they are a decently valued growth company. If you think they will succeed on all of those fronts, they are a spectacular opportunity. If you think they'll succeed on none of those fronts, then they're clearly overvalued and  you can go ahead short them.

Comment by IlllIlIIlIlII: cope hard reddit.
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: Considering that YoY, Tesla earned only 185 million more on regulatory credits this quarter versus Q3 '23, it's not a big deal.  Besides, money is money, regardless of source. 

Regulatory credits are a steady, if small, portion of Tesla's income.  They'll continue to be steady revenue because other automakers aren't transitioning to EVs in high enough volumes.    

By comparison, the Energy business generated 2.376 Billion and Services generated 2.790 Billion.
Comment by rlovepalomar: Clean your glasses, ya need to read the report again
Comment by Intelligent_Top_328: GM 17% EXCLUDING credits.
Comment by SexiestPanda: Could just be cause everything that meets good quarters has gone down lately? Idk lol
Comment by Trademinatrix: yup
Comment by bust-the-shorts: I agree with you and would add those margins look like car company margins, not like a tech company’s margins.  When will they start trading at car company multiples.
Comment by rlovepalomar: Their margins arent predicated on reg credits. Cybertruck effectively has had zero credits given its pricing since production has scaled in 2024. Also 30% + QoQ on energy. Rev dipped slightly but auto gross credits are 20%+ and highest reported in 6 quarters
Comment by MaximusBit21: Yet they weren’t. Smash expectations and keep chugging up lol…. Rocket fuel
Comment by Rabbit_Say_Meow: You get it :)
Comment by Ehralur: The CT was also gross margin positive while they're still heavily ramping it. Meanwhile companies like Ford and GM still have more negative margins than Tesla has ever had in their history (although admittedly Tesla only ever had one quarter where they had negative gross margins), Ford is even struggling to get below -100% gross margin on EVs...
Comment by IlllIlIIlIlII: Get out of the reddit echo chamber.
Comment by lakeoceanpond: In a shareholder deck, Tesla boasted that it reached 7 million vehicles produced on Oct. 22nd, and that its newest offering, the Cybertruck, became the third best-selling fully electric vehicle in the U.S., behind only the Model 3 and Model Y.

That’s crazy, in a good way as I’m long.
Comment by Ancient_Persimmon: That should surprise no one. There are some improvements lately, but no model of EV sold in the US has had the kind of production volume to compete with them.
Comment by Specialist-Routine86: Will be for the foreseeable future as they ramp. US EV volume output besides Tesla is quite pathetic.
Comment by rlovepalomar: This is old news
Comment by Ancalagon_TheWhite: It's a very devisive car. Everyone either loves or hates it. Haters will never touch it, but lovers will buy it since there's nothing that looks similar. 

Even if 90% hate it, 5% can't afford it and 5% love it, that would easily make it No1 in the USA.
Comment by SPorterBridges: Not only that, it also outsold its direct competitors, the F-150 Lightning and Rivian R1T, not just this past quarter but also YTD.

Comment by minthairycrunch: Yeah and they burned through the entire waitlist to get that mark. Now that they have no more waitlist they've slashed the price $20k to drive orders in Q4. Unlikely that it will stay there.

Comment by imamydesk: Really makes you wonder how crazy the numbers would've been if they went with a less radical design.
Comment by Obsidianc21: I made 12% gains which I'm happy about. I can't be upset for not taking profits when it hit the 250+

My cash position is low so this bumps it up to 15% of my portfolio. However, I always feel comfortable increasing my positions in msft, goog, amzn and rtx regardless of the price

LOL
Comment by cheddarben: TSLA can have a good quarter and Elon can still be a twat.

Also, let's not get too masturbatory about it, as TSLA is pretty far off its ATH while the rest of the market has gone nutso. We can argue that other car companies haven't done great either, but as we have been reminded 5000 times, TSLA isn't just a car company. And don't get me wrong, I am not betting against TSLA or Elon (except on Twitter... I did do that), but I certainly don't have a boner for how he has acted for a very long time now.

Comment by ButthealedInTheFeels: This 100%. Elon nutswingers here pretending this is some huge win lol.  
This dogshit stock is at half of its ATH and still overvalued. 
The risk hasn’t been worth the reward since like 2020
Comment by callmecrude: Fair, though I don’t put much weight in short term price action. I rode meta from $180 in 2019 all the way up and then down to $90 in 2022. 3+ years to MASSIVELY underperform SPY. Literally down 50% while SPY was up 20%. But then the past 2 years it’s been a top performer and I’m back up 200%+ since buying in while SPY is up 90%. 

Point being that the best time to buy Meta was when it was down and they were going through struggles. Same with Netflix. Same with Amazon. Same with Palantir. Same with Crowdstrike earlier this year. It’s literally just the same thing over and over again. Buy financially sound companies when they’re down and you will do well. Google is going through it right now and is an obvious buy. Tesla will likely be the same, but people hate Elon enough that they’d rather stick their head in the sand than look at the numbers to acknowledge it.

Comment by Pathogenesls: Tesla includes reg credits in their automotive gross margins.
Comment by upL8N8: Regulatory credits are 100% income (100% corporate profit).  Comparing the first 3 quarters of the year, their regulatory income is approximately $700 million higher than the previous highest year.  

They've pulled in about 1.7 - 1.8 billion in regulatory income in each of the last two years.  They're on course to pull in $2.5+ billion in regulatory income in 2024.  It's a pretty massive chunk of their total net income for having to do absolutely nothing to get it save sell the cars they were going to sell anyways.

Their net income through the first 3 quarters is 4.807 billion, versus $7.069 billion last year, or 32% lower y/y.  Remove the $700 million extra in regulatory credits y/y, and it would have been closer to $4.1 billion or a 42% drop in income y/y on their actual product sales.

They're on course to just about match their total unit vehicle sales y/y; they're still a bit behind last year through Q3.  The problem is that their long term guidance which helped lead to the run up (overvaluation) in the stock price is 50% CAGR between 2020 and 2030.  They rescinded that guidance in Q3 '23 because they don't believe it's possible anymore.  To stay even with the 50% CAGR in 2024, they'd have need to sell over 2.5 million vehicles, but they're on course to sell about 1.8 million.  2025 could see little if any sales growth versus 2023/2024.  However, to maintain the 50% CAGR in 2025, they'd have to hit 3.8 million vehicle sales.

Starting to see the problem?  Their forward PE is based on crazy growth guidance, which even Tesla has admitted they can't hit, yet the stock is still trading at a forward PE of over 80.   Most of the major OEMs across the world trade a forward PE of between 5 and 7.

Tesla's sales aren't growing, their revenue isn't growing, and their income isn't growing, which means their PE is based on nothing more than a hope and a dream.

It seems to me that for the second year in a row, Tesla will only see an annual profit on account of government subsidies and regulatory credit sales.
Comment by Fit-Stress3300: These credits won't last forever.

Other companies won't let Tesla drink their milkshake forever.
Comment by Cannabrius_Rex: Money is money, but it’s a trash accounting trick to inflate what is there. It’s especially dumb because they just didn’t need to do that. They could have followed proper accounting rules

Comment by WINTERGRIFT: Muskrat is going to take us to mars.. once he gets bored of Twitter I mean X
Comment by upL8N8: Regulatory credits are the carbon credits they sell.  It's not the federal / state EV tax credit.  They don't count EV tax credits anywhere since they don't receive them directly.  Although... I'm not sure how that applies to leases, tbh.

Their regulatory credit sales, counted as 100% profit margin, are $700 million higher than last year through the first 3 quarters.  In Q3, regulatory credit sales accounted for 34% of their total net income.

Tesla once again lives on subsidies, whether they're paid by the government, or other OEMs are forced to pay them to Tesla through regulations... which essentially points out just how excessively Tesla's vehicles are subsidized.

$7500 federal tax credit

$1500 - $5000 state tax credit

Hard to say how much they're getting from EV regulatory credit sales per Tesla sold, but my guess would be around $2000 per vehicle.

Add it all up, and Tesla could be getting subsidized on 25%+ of the total sale price of their vehicles.

(EV tax credits benefit Tesla in that Tesla can raise their MSRPs to offset the value of the tax credit, thus taking an equivalent amount of revenue / profit)

They were supposed to do that in July, but waited 2 more months because they still had demand.

Comment by largespacemarine: Not really, you see one maybe once a week and I live in a rich part of LA. I see way more new Tahoes.
Comment by Ehralur: Just for people reading this and being surprised: it's nonsense.

Tesla had 2 million reservations for any type of Cybertruck. They've exhausted the amount of people who wanted a foundation series for 100K, but they're now moving on to the 75K AWD version and there's still a cheaper version coming at some point. People who didn't want the 100K version get to keep their reservation for the cheaper models.
Comment by Pathogenesls: I would say the last 6 is really when the stock became the first memestock and disconnected from fundamentals.

Comment by Climactic9: You were previously using the price movement of a single day as validation yet now you are dismissing the price movement over the course of a year because it is too short term. Cognitive bias?

It is not the same thing over and over. Cisco, blackberry, and IBM were all financially sound yet their stock prices never recovered.

Comment by tech01x: Ah, yes.

There will still be take rate of FSD and other accessories too. And some of that bundle wasn't delivered, and so couldn't be counted in revenue, but is in deferred revenue. And the chunk of that revenue that is FSD can only have a portion counted right away, the rest of it is in deferred revenue.

But yes, overall margins will drop on a per Cybertruck basis, but if they hit their 510k+ volume goal, they will hit a new revenue record.

You shouldn't punish upside volatility that's like saying "if your stock doubles then halves again in a day then you lost" even though it nets out to zero.
Comment by Dread_Pirate_Chris: Yes, but the US is a fraction of the global market -- a significant fraction, but still. And EVs are a small fraction of the global market. 

Being the top share of a mere 5.4% of global sales (2023 BEV sales, I don't count hybrids as 'EVs') isn't that big of a fraction of the global automobile market. 

The question is, will Tesla still be the leader or at least a strong 2nd place when EVs are 98% of the market. (There will always be hobbyist and specialty use ICE vehicles, so it'll never be 100% but it should be close. If you don't believe EVs are the primary future of passenger vehicles, you probably shouldn't be in Tesla in the first place, but there are hydrogen believers. Still.) 

FWIW, I think it's a strong probabilty that they will be. China is the only real concern, I don't see any serious challenge to Tesla dominance coming from anywhere else. On the other hand, China is doing well, and a government-backed Chinese company has ... not quite unlimited funding for expansion, but ... a *lot*. 

There is a real risk though that Tesla is regulated into failure in the US and Europe as political revenge for Elon's activities, Tesla's anti-union position, or both. If not actually shutting Tesla down with red tape, then subsidizing some competition that otherwise wouldn't be a viable threat. 

There has also always been a real risk that Elon says something intemperate that wrecks the China relationship; China has a history anyway of letting foreign companies in to learn their technology before regulating them out or subsidizing the locals enough to push out the foreigners. It didn't happen that way to Apple and may not happen that way to Tesla if they also export enough Chinese-made product to be a net benefit for the Chinese... there's reason to be hopeful. Provided that Elon doesn't retweet any Winnie the Pooh memes, of course.

Anyway, I'm not selling my TSLA position, and odds are IMO reasonable, but it would be a mistake to think that dominating the emerging market in any way guarantees dominating the mature market.
Comment by tech01x: The long term trajectory is in play now... which is a return to growth in 2025.

The financial metrics are good, so regardless of short term movements. Sure, it'll give up some gains, but then probably push back up since plenty of folks are offside.

You're just griping now.
Comment by 34554323454ttttt: >It seems to me that for the second year in a row, Tesla will only see an annual profit on account of government subsidies and regulatory credit sales.

You can call them subsidies all you like, but traditional automakers are able to not report billions in expenses on their income statements because they externalize the cost of pollution and global warming. This is simply leveling the playing field, albeit probably in a nonoptimal way.
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: >Their forward PE is based on crazy growth guidance, which even Tesla has admitted they can't hit, yet the stock is still trading at a forward PE of over 80. Most of the major OEMs across the world trade a forward PE of between 5 and 7.

Forward PE is high because enough major investors still have faith that Tesla's AI efforts could result in profit margins much higher than would be possible on just hardware alone. 

**If Tesla's AI efforts fail, the PE will collapse.**  I've projected that Tesla is only worth $60-$70/share based on vehicle + energy systems alone, which is [a downside of around 70-75% from today's market cap](https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLALounge/comments/1coec01/comment/l3hdpkq/).



>Their net income through the first 3 quarters is 4.807 billion, versus $7.069 billion last year, or 32% lower y/y. Remove the $700 million extra in regulatory credits y/y, and it would have been closer to $4.1 billion or a 42% drop in income y/y on their actual product sales.

Are you willing add back in the 622 million in one-time restructuring charges from last quarter as well?  

Some factors will be transitory.  

It is odd that people are arguing against the regulatory credits counting towards anything, given the small size but consistent presence.  Growing sales of credits, are an argument against them going away in the near term as a small source of revenue
Comment by Swimming-Act-5526: >It seems to me that for the second year in a row, Tesla will only see an annual profit on account of government subsidies and regulatory credit sales.

Comment by helloworldwhile: You can go and short first.
Comment by Ancient_Persimmon: Tesla themselves said in 2022 that they expect to see sequential declines in regulatory credit sales going forward, but they clearly underestimated the incompetence of their rivals.
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: I don't think Tesla is counting on those credits lasting forever, nor should they really care.  

Looking at page 26 of the shareholder slide deck, total revenue for Q3 '24 was  25.182 Billion of which 739 million was regulatory credits.  

* That's 2.935% of their total revenue.  Not a lot.  If it evaporated instantly this would have no practical effect on their expansion plans
   * Operating cash flow was +6.255 Billion and free cash flow +2.742 Billion.  The company has a war chest of 33.648 Billion in liquid assets. (page 4 of slide deck)

Tesla will sell the credits as long as they can.  Why not earn $ when it's there?  But they are certainly not running their business like they need the credits.  It's clear they don't
Comment by helloworldwhile: The problem is that no legacy company is profitable with their EV division. In fact they are pulling money away. They are all hoping for trump to come over and change the rules or the game at the federal level.   
I don’t know how likely is for congress to approve it. But let’s say they do, legacy automakers won’t be able to innovate and move into the EV market.
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: I'm not a CPA, but why does it matter what line the regulatory credit income is located?  

If Tesla categorized it under "other", it would still show up as part of their net income.  This doesn't "inflate" anything when looking at the end result of net income.  

Since the carbon credits are directly tied to sales of vehicles, it makes sense to include them under revenue from business operations.  If Tesla doesn't make and sell cars, they can't get the credits.  This isn't like interest income where $ in the bank compounds even if the company does nothing.
Comment by Ancient_Persimmon: Gross margins are up and those credits don't count towards that.
Comment by Affectionate_You_203: It’s excluding regulatory credits
Comment by Affectionate_You_203: And the cope continues. That’s your cope for how fast it became profitable but what is your cope for why it is already outselling all other EVs on the market? The only cars beating it are other teslas. Lmao
Comment by Flipslips: Wouldn’t the huge majority of the backlog be for the cheaper 40k model? Sounds like they still plan for a cheaper RWD model, though I doubt it will be as low as 40k. Maybe 50 or 60. Either way, I have to imagine most people reserved the cheaper one.
Comment by lakeoceanpond: Time will tell. Impressive feat, even if short lived.  Tesla said in the release that the Cybertruck “achieved a positive gross margin for the first time.”
Another impressive act. A culmination of all things Tesla has done over the years I feel.

And maybe you could have seen that being possible considering their sedan and SUV became the best sellers in their segment, ICE or EV. Yet the Cybertruck is just a footnote in the overall truck market. Why they just didn't make a normal truck like they made a normal SUV and sedan is beyond me.
Comment by Flipslips: Have they officially binned that 40k model Cybertruck? Or is that still upcoming? I’d assume they start at the highest price and work their way down, but I haven’t seen any sort of official confirmation if it’s still coming.

It is currently overvalued for the amount of actual growth we have been seeing and the competitive landscape on the horizon… 
Vaporware shit like the robotaxi and even moreso the stupid van and humanoid robot are just to keep the cult hyped. 
These small bits of positive news which was largely due to regulatory credits (as per usual) are not the big win the fanboys are saying it is.  

If you had just invested the money in SPY since like 2021 you would be waaaaay ahead of TSLA performance.  That’s a long time and not just cherry-picking one or two quarters.

Comment by keridito: IBM is ATH at the moment, how it never recovered?

BB was financially sound in a market that changed radically in 2 years, and they didn’t have the capacity of adapting to the changes. Pretty much what is happening with traditional automotive companies.
Comment by callmecrude: I’m using the fundamentals of this ER to validate my point… you were the only one who brought up the daily price movement.

They showed a massive bump in margins which have been the source of doubt for the past year+. They showed energy generation and storage is still growing exponentially and reaffirmed future growth. They had a huge earnings beat, and signalled that increased energy credits will likely continue as competitors have failed to keep up. These are all massive points to consider when building/updating a DFC model. No disrespect, but you’ve unintentionally proven my point here by bringing emotions into it by calling me biased instead of just objectively looking at the company fundamentals that were released today.

> all of your examples had PE ratios less than 20 during their crashes

Amazon had a PE of 200 during their struggles in 2013 and has never had a PE anywhere near 20.

Palantir has never had a PE anywhere near 20 in their existence, and it was at a forward PE of 200 when they were struggling

Crowdstrike has never had a PE anywhere near 20 and had a PE of 300 when they were struggling and dropping earlier this year.

For “all” of my examples to have a PE below 20 it’s odd how most of them don’t.

Edit, because rereading your comment I’m getting more lost:

> It’s not the same thing over and over. Cisco, blackberry, and IBM were all financially sound yet their stock prices never recovered. 

IBM is literally at all time highs so I don’t have a clue what you’re referencing there. And calling blackberry “financially sound” after their crash is a bit of a stretch given that they were losing billions of dollars a year and completely abandoned their phone business.

Comment by upL8N8: Tesla also pollutes, albeit not as much over the life of the vehicle.  We really don't know what long term environmental impact the mining sites for the battery materials are having though, or what front-loading a high load of emissions is having, such as the difference in manufacturing a BEV w/ a large battery, versus manufacturing an ICEV / Hybrid / PHEV.

Sure, traditional OEMs don't have to report the billions in from environmental damage, however, Tesla's vehicles don't all run on 100% renewable energy, so they too benefit from not paying for environmental damage caused by the electricity production their cars use to move.

I'm all about carbon taxes and taxes on practices that damage the environment to level the playing field, and preferably to move more people way from owning / driving personal vehicles so much.  It's the only fair way to go about it IMO.  Key is that a carbon tax would actually give a huge benefit to people who ride public transit, ride bikes and PEVs, work from home, or in those workers at businesses that implement 4 day work weeks.  Something the EV subsidy programs aren't doing.

Plus, carbon / environmental taxes impact all facets of life, not just transportation.  From the amount of electricity we use at home, the amount of hot water we use, the foods we eat, the things we buy, etc...

The government is spending a LOT of money on a solution that's doing far too little.   The regulatory credit policies are, IMO, not having the impact they were intended to have.  Their primary result has been to build cash in Tesla's coffers and make Elon Musk the richest man on the planet, and starve other initiatives of much needed capital.

Hell, we could have spent the $30+ billion in subsidies that went to Tesla painting bike lanes and had a much larger environmental impact.
Comment by upL8N8: Sure... it's still an AI play... which obviously hasn't kept the stock near their all time highs.  It's been in a continous downtrend since the stock peaked in 2021.

It does beg the question though, how can a project with an endless timeline ever truly fail?  Afterall, FSD has been claimed to be 1-2 years away from completion for 10 straight years now.  Millions of Robotaxis were going to hit the roads in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and now 2025...  If they fail 2025, it'll be 2026, then 2027.  Meanwhile, other real services are already operating, so investors' claim of Tesla instantly enabling robotaxis and quickly gaining a monopoly on not just autonomous taxi services, but all taxi services, instantly wiping out millions of taxi driver jobs...is a bit far fetched.

The more we really consider the complexities, the more unrealistic it sounds.  Hell, Musk is now saying that 2025 will only see robotaxis in some regions of Texas and California... not the nationwide rollout he originally claimed with a simple OTA update.

Then of course there's the hardware concerns... now the claim is HW3 may not actually be able to operate the software.  New cars are on HW4... and now Musk is claiming an HW5 is coming that's well beyond enough power to operate a robotaxi... the same thing he said about HW4...

How about those robots though... those look anywhere close to ready to anyone?  I mean, they were talking to people at robotaxi day... even if it was a human talking through a speaker...

Why would I add back in $622 million in restructuring?  Did they not benefit this quarter and part of last by not having to pay wages to all the people they laid off?  They laid people off because their demand wasn't where they needed it to be, and had they kept those people on staff, Tesla's financials would have been in far worse shape right now.

As I've mentioned in my comments, $740 million in net profits from regulatory credit income on a total net income of $2.2 million isn't a "small size".  It accounts for 33.5% of their total quarterly profit.  And that's just the regulatory carbon credits... it doesn't include federal / state EV tax credits, solar tax credits, battery storage tax credits, tax abatements, etc...
Comment by gymbeaux4: Their AI efforts will fail. Most humans on this planet wrongfully believe that OpenAI (ChatGPT), Google and others are on the precipice of Skynet-level intelligence. 

I work in this space as a software engineer alongside much smarter people than I, and we all agree it’s hype. And that’s the *legitimate* stuff. Then there’s the obvious deception and theatre, like those Tesla “robots” who will do “whatever you want them to do”. It’s snake oil. 

I could tell you all about why Teslas will probably not achieve FSD anytime soon, even in the next 20 years. 

Even ChatGPT is just a “let’s take an approach first conceived of in the 1970s and throw a bunch of data and modern hardware at it”. The results of this are clear as day- ChatGPT is confidently *wrong* all the time. That it isn’t aware of anything that’s happened in the last, say, year- that’s a hint that the training process is very “expensive” for them to do, so they aren’t doing it until they absolutely have to. It’s held together with duct tape like so many military vehicles and bank software and other things that literally make the world run.
Comment by Fit-Stress3300: Part of that is because ICV sales are holding better than expected.

And traditional car companies not having the guts to take 2 or 3 years of increasing Capex to be able to transition to EV.
Comment by upL8N8: Just to repeat from my last comment, and add a bit more info, regulatory credit isn't simple revenue... it's 100% net income... 100% profits.

739 million is 33.6% of Q3's net income.

Keep in mind, a massive chunk of their remaining net income comes from government subsidies.  In the US for example, they're still seeing $7500 federal tax credits on a large percentage of their total sales which allows them to maintain higher MSRPs, translating into higher profit margins.  Most of their sales are in states with state EV tax credits as well, often in the $1500-$2500 range.  Some as high as $5000.

Their energy sales are even more subsidized than their car sales.  The federal government subsidizes something like 30%+ of the overall cost of a solar panel / home battery storage installation.  States with the highest rooftop solar adoption rates often have additional incentives on top.  Overall, it can reach up to 50%.  

I'm not sure on their grid scale power storage, but I'm guessing the subsidies and/or the amount they're charging the government, which often has mandates written into law to have storage installed, are lucrative.

Like 2023... if Tesla were to exclude regulatory credit income and government subsidies from their income, they'd likely be reporting a loss for 2024.  I guess this doesn't technically matter unless there were a risk that the subsidies were going to disappear in short order.. which there's no sign of.

Some headwinds for Q4:

* They've removed their lowest priced trim model 3 near the end of Q3, which had the imported Chinese LFP battery.  That could hit their overall sales numbers in Q4.  It also means they're not going to sell cars with the significantly cheaper LFP packs, which likely generated some decent profit margins.  These units didn't qualify for the full tax credit on sales; although I do believe they still qualified on leases, which Tesla would have had to roll into the lease price.  Not sure if they did or didn't do that.
* They significantly cut the price of the Cybertruck and still don't seem to have a backlog after the price cut; per their estimated delivery dates on their site.
* They've significantly cut the prices on their inventory vehicles.  Model 3s I've seen have up to $3k discounts applied.  Model Y has as much as $4k discounts applied.  Model Y accounts for the majority of their sales.  That said, they were also aggressively discounting inventory vehicles last year in Q4.
* They're offering 0% financing offers; which I believe is new this year.  While this won't impact their unit sales, it will mean additional losses of up to $5k per vehicle over the course of the loan that they otherwise would have made on interest.

I do expect Tesla to break their sales numbers from last year, if only because they're so deeply discounting their vehicles.  However, I expect their revenue and net income to be down in Q4 y/y as a result of their deep discounting.
Comment by Fit-Stress3300: I don't see Tesla keeping those margins AND growth at the same time.

The business of paying premium for an EV because you are environmentally conscious and/or wanted to be on the bleeding edge of technology is over.

Elon tarnished the brand with half of the US - and more of the people with resources to pay the premium.

Tesla has no moat nor secret sauce. 

Unless Elon plan to control Trump is successful and they become the only viable EV manufacturers in America.
Comment by Pathogenesls: Tesla does actually count the credits towards their gross automotive margins. It's one of the biggest criticisms of their accounting.
Comment by Cannabrius_Rex: It’s how it’s become profitable. They cut many many corners. Bottom line, they sold those dumpy trucks. So despite the atrocious build quality to make profitability possible, consumers are still buying. One of the benefits of cultivating a cult for your base. That’s good for investors, as long as they understand their investment
Comment by Affectionate_You_203: Especially impressive when you realize all other EV trucks are still not profitable even though they’ve been out for years
Comment by skoldpaddanmann: You can check their website right now. You can order any truck trim and get it in 2 weeks which is the minimum time on a custom order. I would imagine if there was still a backlog that would be higher. 

If the overwhelming majority of people who were interested enough in the truck to pay $100 to reserve it pass on it I'm curious how they will convince normal people to buy it especially considering how much worse the specs are than the announcement specs.

Comment by SkynetProgrammer: I'm a huge bull, I knew this would happen
Comment by Dynasty3310: Yes it is beyond you, that’s why you’re not CEO
Comment by ImStupidButSoAreYou: What would make it not a failure in your eyes?

They are less than a year into ramping production and have been these selling things for over $100k until very recently. Clearly it's in demand. It's already profitable, and they've already scaled faster than any other EV truck. The numbers will only improve as they scale production, make it more efficient, and lower the price to increase demand, as we have seen with every other vehicle Tesla has made so far.

And in the grand scheme of things, pickup trucks are only a thing in NA. It is ultimately like 5% of Tesla's projected 20m/year vision.
Comment by SkynetProgrammer: I read once they had a backup plan if Cybertruck was a failure, but there is currently demand that they still cannot produce enough to meet.

Why would they release a normal truck in that situation?
Comment by relevant_rhino: The RWD model will come out at something like 60k (guess). 

I doubt we will see a 40k model. Maybe in a couple years when market is saturated we will see something around 50k that is basically 40k if adjusted for inflation.
Comment by Affectionate_You_203: It’s now 50k after federal rebate and inflation but it’s coming out in a few months
Comment by Ehralur: I find that hard to believe, but from what I could find so far it does seem like you're right. Does make me wonder how long they'll wait before releasing the RWD, as a $60K car has about 3x the market size as a $80K car. Ultimately they might need the $40K version after all, with ~10x the market size.
Comment by skilliard7: Who cares? EVs are a novelty and have been a colossal failure.
Comment by Pathogenesls: He's been promising autonomous vehicles "next year" for the last 10 years. His system is okay as a level 2 ADAS but it's still needs to improve about 1000% before they can even start testing autonomous driving.

Comment by Pathogenesls: Lol, no shit. Now imagine you didn't calculate cashflows, assumed 10 years of growth happened magically overnight and then reprinted the stock for a further 10 years into the future. That's Tesla.
Comment by RonTom24: This stock ran to an insane valuation way too soon, it's not that the company hasn't delivered since then, it's just that it is taking time to grow into the lofty valuation the stock market assigned it in 2020/2021. The p/e ratio back then was over 1000, it's not Elon or the companies fault that the stock market got so frothy and speculative investors ran the price so high.
Comment by -bluff: thats fair, i was just pointing out that using an arbitrary date to reflect your point doesn't show the full picture of the stock. elon has managed to drag the tesla brand into a lot of his own personal ideations and it is reflected in the stock price/brand image.
Comment by New-Connection-9088: It's up 1,394% over a five year period. Isn't it interesting how a different narrative can be painted based on the time frame.
Comment by TheIguanasAreComing: You again are cherrypicking time periods, why did you choose 2020 and 2021 but not 2015?
Comment by Climactic9: I actually didn’t know that ibm finally hit their ATH after a decade of stagnation. That doesn’t change the fact that it would’ve been a shit investment if you had bought it after their dip.

In hindsight the reasons why a company like bb failed become obvious. It is much harder to tell before/during the downturn. It remains to be seen if tesla’s growth and margins has the capacity to adapt to the changes in the ev market.
Comment by Climactic9: I will admit, I jumped to some conclusions and exaggerated some things. However, “Cognitive bias?” = emotional is a bit perplexing. 

Black berry crashed in 2008 and saw stagnant stock price during 2009-2011 even with solid financials while the rest of the market was climbing. People thought they were undervalued. Nope. 

IBM hit an all time high after a decade of stagnation while the rest of the market went on one of the biggest bull runs in history. 

Tesla could end up like one of these.
Comment by upL8N8: Of course it was.  It just hadn't realized its potential yet.
Comment by TheIguanasAreComing: 
“Ironic (n.): A situation where you’re forced to deal with excessive amounts of iron, like tripping over a wrought iron fence while carrying a bag of iron supplements, only to realize your shirt has an embarrassing iron-on decal that reads ‘I’m a master of fate’.”
Comment by TheIguanasAreComing: Not grief but copium, Tesla is an excellent company regardless of if you think it is overvalued or if Elon is unethical.
Comment by relevant_rhino: Yea because money is money. Arguably, it coming from competitors not meeting emission goals is even better.
Comment by anthonyjh21: Yep, gotta remove those one time, 44 consecutive quarters of reg credits...
Comment by jwrig: If only they had some sort of framework they had to use for accounting, and that we had an outside firm audit their accounting practices and controls so they just couldn't get away with making things up...
Comment by imamydesk: You should look up cradle to grave life cycle assessments, rather than relying on "hey industrialized production has a non zero amount of pollution too so aha! Gotcha!". Spoilers, increased costs of battery production is broken even within a year or two of driving.


Oh and, there are also lots of such studies assuming charging on power grids that's fossil fuel based. Spoiler again, even in a purely coal powered grid, EVs are still better.


At some point you have to 1) educate yourself on this environmental matter you seem to be passionate about, and 2) step away from the sort of all-or-nothing logical fallacy.
Comment by 34554323454ttttt: >Tesla's vehicles don't all run on 100% renewable energy, so they too benefit from not paying for environmental damage caused by the electricity production their cars use to move.

Moot point. As you acknowledge at the beginning of your comment, Tesla pollutes far less than its competitors. With advances in battery and solar tech, this discrepancy will only grow.

>I'm all about carbon taxes and taxes on practices that damage the environment

I have already stated that the subsidies that Tesla receives are a nonoptimal solution to the problem of external cost accounting. 

>and preferably to move more people way from owning / driving personal vehicles so much.

Politically unfeasible.
Comment by gymbeaux4: I used to work for a guy at a global logistics company. We were tasked with building something that had never been built before, using Machine Learning(TM).  The idea is simple. The theory is pretty simple. The actual construction of something that is as good or better than a human at performing a job…. Very difficult. We did not succeed and the project was cancelled. Now we were a motley crew to say the least- most of my coworkers were Serbian and frankly not very intelligent. Nevertheless, I don’t foresee the “brightest minds” solving the problem. I equate the problem of having a computer do human tasks (like driving a car) to putting a man on the moon, curing HIV, or harnessing nuclear fusion. The THEORY is straightforward. The implementation often requires the literal invention of new elements and materials (in the case of NASA’s Gemini, Apollo and Space Shuttle programs).

So we know at a high level how to “build” FSD. I guarantee the guys at Tesla working on it have the “theory” nailed down. The implementation is what they are struggling with. Like driving, **perfection** is required to get people to and from space safely, cure HIV, or harness nuclear fusion. This is not shit that can be wrong half the time (or even 20% of the time) like ChatGPT. ChatGPT is child’s play compared to FSD. Elon being an arrogant idiot failed and probably still fails to realize why FSD is more like “nuclear fission” than “BonziBuddy”.
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: >And that's just the regulatory carbon credits... it doesn't include federal / state EV tax credits, solar tax credits, battery storage tax credits, tax abatements, etc...

People like to pretend these don't count because they aren't "fair" on some political grounds (libertarians in particular seem to hate Tesla due to the company having tax code advantages) or because they think these are temporary.  That is denial of reality.  These sources of income exist and they are not going away anytime soon.

>It does beg the question though, how can a project with an endless timeline ever truly fail?

When the investment community stops believing and the markets stop considering Tesla an AI stock.

I don't know exactly when or how that could happen, but at some point, people could lose faith and Tesla's 800+ Billion market cap would deflate.  I can see some scenarios:

* A competitor like Waymo achieves FSD first and takes over the space entirely.
* Tesla itself writes off Billions of dollars of AI training hardware if it becomes apparent that current Neural Net software methodologies are insufficient and the datacenters they set up are useless.  I've seen similar writedowns in the biotech space:  a company finds that their path on a project is on a dead end and they sell off all the equipment for that project.
* Governments deem Tesla's AI projects to be dangerous and either regulate them out of existence or seize them outright.

I believe that for the next few years, TSLA will continue to inflict psychological (and possibly financial) harm on everyone:

* TSLA bulls with blind faith in Musk will insist that the company is much more valuable than its market cap, and be continually upset by erratic earnings and uncertain progress with no guarantee of success.
* TSLA bears who hate the company will keep harping on its market cap as overinflated and be continually upset by the multi-hundreds of Billions valuation.

Most people IMO should avoid having anything to do with TSLA either long or short.  I actively tell anyone I know to avoid TSLA.

* The vast majority of people I know who had anything to do with this stock from 2011-2020 lost money, and a lot of it, no matter how they tried to play it.
Comment by gymbeaux4: Yeah people are still buying ICE vehicles. Any legislation that forces Ford et al to move away from ICE and towards EVs will be bearish for TSLA
Comment by Flipslips: I mean auto margins were up 3% to 17% (ex reg credits) and Energy margins are 30%. That’s pretty major. And Elon has been off the rails for at LEAST a year or two now. At what point will things start taking a turn down?
Comment by stoked_7: Its third-quarter profit margin from vehicle sales, excluding regulatory credits, grew to 17.05% from 14.6% in the prior three-month period, according to Reuters calculations.

Comment by Affectionate_You_203: You sound like the people in 2010 on the internet saying Apple was a cult and list 50 different reasons why the iPhone is a crap product compared to Android
Comment by tech01x: There's a crap ton of people waiting for some clarity on a few things, like the $7,500 tax credit. Once they get their new cells with new cathode material, it should allow for the $80,000 version to have a $7,500 tax credit.

Just because some people can get in line and get theirs in a couple of weeks doesn't mean everyone can.

The specs are extremely competitive against other BEV pick up trucks. It doesn't matter much how it competes against the pre-COVID specs. What matters is how it competes today.
Comment by Affectionate_You_203: I’m long as well. Almost 1000 shares. Reddit makes me laugh with their shit takes. They’ll post pics of their posts years from now asking how no one seen it coming that Tesla would blow up to be the biggest company in the world.
Comment by hoopaholik91: > It is ultimately like 5% of Tesla's projected 20m/year vision.

And yet 5% of 20m is one million. Even the F-series only sells 750k a year at this point. A 60k+ steel box is never going to sell like that.
Comment by hoopaholik91: If their production capacity is only 15k trucks a quarter, then that only reinforces the point that they decided to make some weird concept car instead of something actually mass producable
Comment by JerryLeeDog: Why is this extremely accurate comment downvoted?

Are people that fucking butthurt?
Comment by skoldpaddanmann: Personally I don't think the RWD will be made unless demand is unreasonably bad. Musk cancelled the promised SR RWD model y because of low range, and the RWD trucks range is lower then that was going to be if I recall correctly. I imagine the real world range is well under that 250 range estimate. 

I think you are right though if they brought a low cost electric vehicle to market it would sell like got cakes. However they don't seen to interested in that. Musk let it slip on the call there new 30k vehicle in development is actually 30k post credits which means it's basically a grand or two cheaper then the 3 is now. 

Also as I said earlier their marketing strategy seems to be to promise a low cost model at announcement, but cut it before production.
Comment by tech01x: Clearly not.
Comment by AoeDreaMEr: 5 years late comment.
Comment by Low-Possibility-7060: I’m with you here. The robotaxi is already reality - it’s made by waymo.
Comment by Scuczu2: Ya just looked at when it first hit this price
Comment by keridito: I think BB and IBM are very different cases. While the IBM case is more complex (they survived the PC era thanks to their mainframe business and supplying PowerPC for Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony game consoles, and lately Quantum Computing has made them to be relevant again), whoever invested in them and kept it during this time, in the end they have been rewarded. And looking at the graph now, from an ATH of \~200 they went down to \~100 in 2020 and they are now at 230. Not too bad. And considering they are one of the most important actors in quantum computing, they will probably continue growing at a good pace.

Blackberry is a completely different story. It is true that before the turndown, no one saw it coming. Essentially, no one saw the iPhone coming. Once the iPhone was out, it was clear from the first day that it was a game-changer. Every possible actor had to react very quickly or die sooner or later. The most evident victims were Nokia and BB. 

Google was able to react quickly by removing the keyboard from Android. The first versions did not support virtual keyboards (I guess everyone remembers Steve Ballmer laughing at a phone that cost $ 500$ and didn't even have a keyboard). 

It took them a few years to move to Android, and by then, it was way too late.

I didn't have any shares on BB back then, but I would have dumped them shortly after seeing that the only BB business model was no longer relevant and that they were not reacting to the changes.

With Tesla, although it is clear they will not keep growing the way they did before, it seems unlikely that today they will follow the path BB took. Together with the Chinese EV manufacturers, they are the reference right now. And Tesla has other businesses besides the cars that make them relevant. The influence of Musk is another story, though.
Comment by Bronze-Soul: Lots of effort but no cigar. 
Comment by BenMic81: Well, the thing is it’s a political and transitory part of margin. If legacy automakers shift to electric or regulatory credit regime changes then that margin goes away quickly. 

Not a catastrophe though as Tesla would be profitable anyway and stock prices of Tesla have nothing to do with realistic earning outlook but fantasy of future things to come.
Comment by Pathogenesls: It's not industry standard and it's why their gross automotive margins look so inflated.

Gross automotive margins should just be the ratio of revenue from sales of vehicles to cost of goods sold for their automotive business. It should not include revenue from sales of other items such as regulatory credits.

Comment by upL8N8: Cradle to grave assessments don't cover things like mining.  I've been in the EV community and been researching this topic for a very very very long time, bud.  There are certainly unknowns that are never mentioned or covered, which is why I mention those things out in my comments.

For example, I didn't say "increased cost of battery production".  I specifically noted the high front loading of high emissions.  Why did I mention this?

The planet can only sequester so much carbon over a given period.  What happens if we significantly increase the amount of carbon we produce in a given year on account of a manufacturing process that spikes the levels of emissions?  What are the impacts to the environment?  Does it result in more ocean acidification, because the CO2 is sucked up by the oceans instead of the forests?  Thus leading to devastation of coral reefs and oceanic plant life, and styming the Ocean's ability to sequester more carbon? Again, not something covered in cradle to grave assessments..

Sure, power grids are changing... slowly... and will continue to do so over time.   That doesn't mean there aren't significantly better solutions to the environmental problem than simply "MOAR CARS!".  We're to the point where every bit of CO2 we inject into the atmosphere will likely require more energy and time to suck back out of the atmosphere in the future with CO2 sequestration processes.  IMO, the best solution is to not emit in the first place.  We, humans, need to drastically reduce our carbon footprints in a very short period of time.  

BEVs help, never said they don't.  Dollar for impact... they're about the slowest solution for reducing global emissions.
Comment by gymbeaux4: I don’t see how you can lose by shorting TSLA, you just have to be patient. Bill Gates is a famous TSLA perma-Bear. Imagine the people he has access to- PhDs whose sole jobs are to develop machine learning have probably told him how unrealistic FSD is. After that it’s a simple matter of comparing TSLA the automaker to the PE of the other automakers.

If you aren’t in the AI/ML space it’ll seem like a black box, and a “coin flip” on whether TSLA truly creates full self-driving. For the rest of us, we know the odds are “more likely not”. 20 years from now, maybe. 5 years from now? Hell no. I put it at around a 3% chance they “figure it out”.
Comment by jwrig: Waymo isn't going to replace fsd.  Waymo requires geo fencing and months of training within that geofence. You can't drop a waymo in the middle of a city like Topeka Kansas and have it start working.  You can however drop a Tesla in Topeka and it starts working.
Comment by Fit-Stress3300: Well.
Growth has stalled for about 2 years now.

If you think Tesla is a energy company, so it should have the multiples of a slow growth Energy Company.
Comment by upL8N8: Tesla's net income is down 32% y/y through the first three quarters of the year, and that's considering that they've sold $700 billion more in regulatory credits this year over that period

$7.069 billion -- Q1-Q3 2023

$4.807 billion -- Q1-Q3 2024

Excluding the $700 million in additional regulatory credit sales this year versus last, Tesla's net income is $4.107 billion in 2024, which is 42% lower than last year.
Comment by Cannabrius_Rex: Have you looked at the dozens of videos with these cultists making excuses for catastrophic failures while driving slowly in a straight line. Or slamming their door shut and it peeling apart when they try to open it again because it’s all plastic junk on the inside? I absolutely believe it. Look at the cult following for Trump while he is objectively a terrible business man and garbage human. Cults aren’t rare guy, humans are deeply susceptible.

There’s also no shortage of wealthy idiots

Comment by skoldpaddanmann: I checked several area codes around the US, and everyone was 0 additional wait time. It's been pretty widely reported the reservations appear to be done for at least a few days now, and haven't seen evidence otherwise. 

Have they ever talked about the cells again since battery day? The last thing I have heard about them is they are just a much larger and slightly worse battery than the smaller form factor. I haven't seen anything that they have actually achieved the breakthroughs they expected years ago for the most part.

If all these recent price cuts across all models and 20% price cuts on the truck it's probably better to wait for more cuts rather than credits. Plus you won't get hit with that bonus depreciation from future price cuts.

There regulatory credits come from the EU, China, US CAFE GHG, CARB ZEV, and others. Legacy automakers are doing a piss poor job of meeting ever more stringent emissions standards across the globe. If anything, the regulatory credits are likely to increase over the next few years.
Comment by imamydesk: > If legacy automakers shift to electric or regulatory credit regime changes then that margin goes away quickly.


Well that's kinda like saying "if a competitor can sell the same product cheaper the demand goes away". You can say that about ANY company.
Comment by relevant_rhino: I agree
Comment by relevant_rhino: Hehe yea, it's not industry standard because no one in the industry except Tesla has enough to sell them in volume.

These are not made out of thin air (maybe out of clean air), but are a direct result of EV sales.
Comment by tech01x: It is a part of the auto industry. There is no reason to count it separately.

"Resource extraction".


Not long enough it seems, bud.
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: >I don’t see how you can lose by shorting TSLA, you just have to be patient.

That was the common wisdom several years ago when Tesla was close to 11 Billion in debt, with massive loan repayments continually looming (the SEC filings disclosed note amounts, interest rate, and maturity dates), and a manufacturing operation that seemed perpetually in chaos.

"Structurally unprofitable" was what the vast majority of financial experts were saying.

Except we know that it didn't end well for those betting against the stock:

[https://www.advisorhub.com/ubs-top-wisconsin-broker-face-23-million-claim-over-tesla-short/](https://www.advisorhub.com/ubs-top-wisconsin-broker-face-23-million-claim-over-tesla-short/)

>*A UBS financial advisor in Madison, Wisconsin who oversees a 35-person team “repeatedly promoted the idea of short selling” shares of the electric car company Tesla, Inc., triggering* ***more than $23 million in losses*** *for four couples—all members of an extended family—and another investor, according to an arbitration claim filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.*

>***“His recommendation focused on his conviction that lots of money would be made because Tesla common stock was overvalued and certain to lose its value,”*** *the plaintiffs argued. “No balanced view of the risk of loss was provided by Burish.”*

It is extraordinarily reckless to reach such conclusions with absolute certainty.

The people who are so sure they "can't lose" are the ones who get wiped out.

That goes for the ultra bulls too.

* Plenty of TSLA shareholders got wiped out by margin calls when Elon Musk repeatedly betrayed and stabbed them in the back with open-market share dumps in late 2022.  He kept lying saying he was done selling TSLA stock to fund the Twitter buyout, only to keep selling TSLA stock over and over, driving the price from over 400 to near 100.  

You think you can't lose.  **You have a chance lose it all, no matter which side of the stock you're on.**
Comment by rgl9: You can drop a Tesla in Topeka and FSD will crash the car unless the driver takes over
Comment by Flipslips: Sure. But that could be several factors such as an aging product lineup, tough macroeconomy, supply chain issues AND/OR Elon going off the rails. 

However, Cybertruck is now the third best selling EV, behind the Model 3 and Model Y. So sales are not so stagnant. 

I do think Tesla is also an energy company. In fact it becomes less and less a car company every quarter. Energy growth was 52% YoY. 30% margins. 

“Other” revenue (energy, etc) accounts for over 20% of revenue now. That’s pretty huge.

Edit: I’m listening to the earnings call right now and they forecast 20-30% car volume growth next year, probably thanks to lower cost model launching in first half of 2025.
Comment by Affectionate_You_203: “The internet told me”

You realize that companies who want you to believe their competition is bad and failing can use the internet to curate narratives to try to sway people’s opinions right? You also realize that the internet is not real life and the people you see posting all the time are not representative of the average person?
Comment by Affectionate_You_203: People love apple no matter how much android fanboys online flood threads with hate. Tesla is the same. People love their teslas and the model Y is the most popular car in the world for a reason. Just because the majority of people have a different opinion than you, it doesn’t automatically equate to CuLt!
Comment by Affectionate_You_203: My reservation is for the RWD version so how on earth could you claim they’re done with all the reservations? Also the tax credit is on hold right now while the government drags their feet on certifying the new 80k model that literally just became available a few days ago.

Just because the US is lagging behind, does not mean there isnt a trend towards EV. 

Many consumers want EV for the lower fuel costs, but cant afford the initial buy in of EV (im one of those people, and i know more like me).
Comment by BenMic81: In 2035 there will be no more new ICE cars in the EU. That’s a “at the latest” date for the regulatory credits there.
Comment by BenMic81: No it’s not. In the EU no more new ICE cars will be allowed after 2035. There’s a difference between state ordered subsidies to competitors that have a virtual end date and normal product competition.
Comment by Pathogenesls: It's not industry standard to include anything other than the vehicle sale price in the calculation. It's just one of the more egregious accounting tricks that Tesla uses to make it's financial health look better than it is.
Comment by largespacemarine: Uh no that's completely incorrect.
Comment by upL8N8: You're referring to extraction of fuel.  When it comes to BEVs.. it's extraction of raw materials (metals) AND fuel (in the event the power plant is using fossil fuels).
Comment by upL8N8: Also, I find your complaints a little odd; given that the first line of my original comment was:

"Tesla also pollutes, albeit not as much over the life of the vehicle. "
Comment by ResearcherSad9357: Several years ago Musk wasn't jumping up and down on stage for a fascist.  Computer scientists and college grads in general skew left.  Tesla is a ticking time bomb, which is why Elon is acting so very desperate.
Comment by gymbeaux4: That was a lot of text for you to type out just to list the top two paradigms of the stock market:

Comment by jwrig: Maybe, maybe not, at least it moves unlike the waymo.
Comment by Fit-Stress3300: Yeah....
But the margins of the best energy companies in the world would not justify Tesla valuation.

There is a fundamental reason tech company can have their multiples. They don't deal with products and productivity limited by physical materials.

But faith and belief can last a long way, specially when you become too big to fail.

I have no idea what would take to bring Tesla price down to where it "should be".
Comment by upL8N8: CT is the third best selling EV... which isn't saying much.  It's still seeing low quarterly unit sales.  Tesla's also recently lowered prices (or at least no longer requires an expensive package which consists of software and what's essentially a few cheap pieces of plastic/metal), and it's pretty clear from their order page that there's no backlog remaining for this vehicle.  At least, not at these prices.  We also know that CT sales seem to be cannibalizing model S/X sales... or maybe S/X customers are just going the way of the dodo, and new buyers came in to buy the CT.  Maybe a mix of both.  Either way, they're trading two high cost / potentially high margin vehicles for one.

Cars still make up the lion's share of their revenue.  Both divisions rely on large orders of cells.  One can't exist without the other.  If car sales slow down, Tesla offloads excess cells through their energy division.  It just so happens that their energy products are subsidized to a much larger percentage than their vehicles.  How large the overall market is for their energy products is anyone's guess.  Frankly, Li-ion isn't exactly the most cost effective way for storing energy in a static location.  Solar roof seems to generally be a failure of a product.  Ironically, their powerwall sales would likely be far lower if they actually allowed V2L capabilities in their non-CT vehicles.  It's a a conflict of interest for them to enable V2L capabilities in their vehicles, which is kind of silly when you think about it.  They're screwing the customer intentionally to pad their own pocketbooks.

I imagine 'Other' revenue may have been FSD.  Remember that near the end of the quarter, Tesla started offering 0% financing, but only if you bought FSD.  It essentially made FSD cost like $1k or something after all was said and done.  Early in Q4 now... Tesla's removed that requirement and is now just offering 0% financing on their model 3 and Y with no need to buy FSD.  They're also discounting their model 3 / Y inventory by $2k - $4k.

Not listening to the earnings call so don't know what he's saying about their forecast, but I doubt it...  Without a new lower priced model, or deeply discounting their existing models, their market isn't large enough.  We don't know where the economy will be next year, but it could certainly worsen.  It seems calls for a recession aren't as large as they have been, but I can certainly see some economic troubles.  Growing credit card debt, credit card defaults, and auto loan defaults don't just magically go away.

The real question is where will this magic increase in volume come from?  30% volume growth is an additional 540,000 vehicles produced and sold.  They have no new factories under construction AFAIK.  I can't see CT sales volumes growing much without significant price cuts, and I definitely don't think they'll be selling over 100k of them next year.  Much like the F-150L, I think there was the initial pent up demand, but once it's out, it's going to be a long slog to growth in that sector.

Also, where are they planning to grow their sales?  The US?  Europe?  China?  I'm guessing China, where they very well may be expanding; haven't heard much news on that front lately.  However, if they're expanding, they're expanding at a time when all of the Chinese OEMs are also rapidly expanding.  Somehow I don't think Tesla's market will grow by 440k units in China in one year.  Although... I mean China just enabled their government to buy Tesla vehicles... the first foreign brand they've ever enabled that for.  China also seems to be abnormally beholden to Tesla for some reason.
Comment by Cannabrius_Rex: Video evidence told me, but nice cope. I see you’re a conspiratorial type. You also like Joe Rogan? Lol
Comment by Cannabrius_Rex: I didn’t say every person using Apple is in the cult. Same with teslazis. Are you purposefully making obtuse arguments or are you actually serious? You seem to think I’m here to hate on this stock which is objectively doing really well for its investors. This is a solid investment BECAUSE of what I’m saying. You’ve got a cult backing up this stock. It can perform terribly and it won’t matter. Just like right now it’s obscenely overvalued but that doesn’t matter. This isn’t tied to fundamentals, it’s tied to a cult.
Comment by skoldpaddanmann: I thought the RWD was cancelled a few months back as you can't even order them anymore. Tesla usually never makes or barely makes any of the base option they advertise like the cloth seat 3, or the SR Y. Think they did it with the S and X as well with small battery sizes but less sure. They do it so they can advertise a super low future price point they will never meet like the 40k truck.

Comment by skilliard7: Why is Tesla's sales growing so slow then?
Title : Alphabet To $7 Trillion By 2025?
We believe Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) is positioned to grow its valuation by well over 3x from the already huge $2-trillion figure now – potentially becoming the world’s most valuable company by a huge margin – as its often-overlooked Waymo autonomous driving business quietly revolutionizes the transportation sector. This would take the stock to over $500 a share. Here’s why.

Fact: Waymo has grown the number of weekly paid rides from 10,000 to over 100,000 in the last 12 months. It went from 50,000 weekly rides to 100,000 just in the last six months.

The growth is compelling and the addressable market is massive

Case in point: Uber does more than 200 million rides each week. Let’s let that sink in. So if autonomous rides can capture even half that market, that would mean 100 million rides per week. That’s about 1,000 times where Waymo is today. 200 million rides a week translates to about a billion a month and over 10 billion a year. At $30 per ride, we’re talking revenues of close to $300 billion per year.

But wait… there is more to the growth story

If Waymo is already delivering over 100,000 driverless rides, how many more people might switch from driving their cars to being driven by autonomous vehicles? The shift could be massive. For each person hailing a cab, there are at least 10 others driving their own cars. Many of these drivers might reconsider once they see millions of people relaxing in the back seat, streaming Netflix, while they’re stuck behind the wheel.

In fact, early data backs this up. According to Earnest Analytics, Waymo is already retaining riders at a higher rate compared to other ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft. People enjoy the experience of autonomous vehicles. Safety could also be another attraction. Waymo published a report last year indicating that its autonomous vehicles achieved an 85% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to national rates for human-operated cars.

Investors will soon recognize that the $300 billion revenue figure for the current ride-hailing market has substantial growth potential – it could easily expand by 2-3x. A $1 trillion market for autonomous rides isn’t out of the question. This growth would also translate to significant revenue opportunities for automakers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which are working on their driverless vehicle technologies.

But wait aren’t so many automakers and tech players working on autonomous driving?

Yes, but not all of them are making the same progress. Waymo has a head start in the market. Its main competitor, General Motor’s backed Cruise lost its driverless permits in California after a serious accident, making Waymo the only publicly available robotaxi service in San Francisco. Uber exited its self-driving taxi program about six years ago and has partnered with Waymo to bring its services to the Uber app in some cities. While electric vehicle behemoth Tesla is seen as a leader of sorts in the self-driving space, given its large base of vehicles, it is only slowly getting into the space after the unveiling of its Robotaxi vehicle earlier this month.

Waymo has some advantages in terms of tech as well. It uses a fleet equipped with high-resolution cameras, LiDAR, and radar systems, creating a comprehensive view of its surroundings. And don’t forget Google’s got a secret weapon. It crowdsources annotated data such as CAPTCHA codes from its massive user base, using that to train its machine-learning models. That’s a big advantage in terms of understanding complex driving environments.

The best part?

These are self-driving cars – no human drivers, no unions, no employee or contractor issues, and no human cost. While there will be other expenses, such as software development and battery costs, the absence of driver wages could lead to exceptionally high margins. Margins of 50% aren’t unrealistic when you consider that driver earnings account for a substantial portion of gross fares in traditional ride-hailing models.

If Waymo can capture about one-third of the $1 trillion autonomous rides market, it could generate annual revenues of around $300 billion. With a 50% margin, that’s a neat $150 billion in profits. What’s that worth? At a 30x earnings multiple, that would imply an additional valuation of about $4.5 trillion for Alphabet. Considering that Alphabet is worth roughly $2 trillion presently, this could take the company’s market cap to over $6.5 trillion, or over $500 per share.

To be sure, building this sort of scale can take a good deal of time – quite different from signing up for say a Google or Netflix account. However, investors will need to look well out into the future. Think 2030 (not 2025), maybe even more. The point is not to get stuck – if you’re concerned, look even further out, say 2035! The bottom line: Alphabet is growing Waymo quickly, has the technology and competitive edge, and is addressing a potentially massive market, making this high valuation within reach.

Comment by creemeeseason: So, the thesis is that waymo will fully capture the entire US ride-sharing market by....next year? And people will give up their cars and use those services as well by.....next year?

Also, waymo has to buy and maintain their own cars, unlike Uber. Therefore, they are likely to have much higher costs than Uber. How fast can waymo even manufacture their vehicles?

No offense, this reads like something ARKK would put out.
Comment by pain474: >Alphabet To $7 Trillion By 2025?

No. You're welcome.
Comment by not_creative1: $7 trillion is a bit out there, but yes, I am bullish on Google too. I expect it to double in 2 years. Google’s forward PE today is almost half of that of Apple, Microsoft etc. Google is positioned best right now with AI (own model, trained on own hardware, tons of data and their own cloud service). They also have some amazing long term bets like Waymo.

The main risk is regulatory, with all the talk of breaking up Google

NotebookLM, Waymo, Wing, Calico, Verily, Isormophic labs. Plus their investments in Medical AI, robotics and Quantum Computing

And they still got their golden goose is Search, Android , YouTube. GCP is also picking up.
Comment by callmecrude: Waymo in its current form is massively unprofitable. You can’t just scale up their numbers and assume they become a $6T company, because they’d literally go bankrupt from the trillions of dollars in losses it would take to operate that size of a fleet. 

Their retrofitted cars cost something like $180k when they need to ideally be under $40k for the payoff to make any sense. That isn’t going to happen next year. Probably not for a decade. 

Not to mention Waymo rides are currently more expensive than a comparable Uber or Lyft ride. If they expect widespread adoption then their fares need to get cut in half, which circles back to the massively unprofitable issue.
Comment by hatetheproject: Why would they be able to charge enough to earn a 50% margin in a competitive market. It relies on no one else being able to develop the same technology. That's a pretty big bet. And 3x in 11 years (based on your 2035 number, which is the only even slightly reasonable one)? That's only a 10.5% CAGR. Not amazing, considering the leap of faith you're taking in assuming no one can develop the same tech.

I think you’d do better to present a pro/con list of Waymo, address possible/likely challenges they’ll have in the next 2 years. People would appreciate this. 

7 trillion isn’t happening even by 2030. Hence why you can’t buy an option on it. Best wishes.
Comment by 95Daphne: This ludicrous call just motivates me to sell all of my shares in Google from 2019 to be honest, if I were to do something drastic.


I was wrong to say sentiment is in the trash can here. It's not, you have too many people thinking the stock is an uncovered gem, and it's why it won't return to its all time high to wrap up 2024 while the Nasdaq is probably at 99%+ to do it.

Firstly there's tonnes of human cost to driverless vehicles. They need oversight, rescue, cleaning and maintainance, things which the driver usually does. 

It's really not clear what waymos margin structure is like and if theyre making any profit at all it would be a shock given the high cost of the vehicles and the amount of mapping and monitoring they require. 

Secondly Google is getting it's search businesss, which makes 90% of it's profit, disrupted by chatbots while we speak. 

If next gen chatbots are a similar step up then Google is done then.

Comment by DanielBeuthner: TLDR: Autonomous driving is a trillion-dollar market that is not just about replacing Uber, Lyft or taxis, but about changing the entire transport sector. In this huge market, Alphabet, with Waymo as the technology leader, has the opportunity to gain huge market share which could result in billions of $ in annual profits.

Comment by ShadowLiberal: Their thesis is even more absurd if you google how many cities Waymo has expanded into in the last year or two, it's a number in the low to mid single digits. 

That alone should tell you just how absurdly long it's going to take for Waymo to get anything close to being able to drive you from anywhere on East coast to anywhere on the West coast or vice versa. And until they can do that no one is going to give up their car, nor can they accomplish a number of other potential uses for self driving vehicles (like for example ditching drivers in delivery/shipment vehicles).
Comment by DanielBeuthner: 1. The title is just provocative. Please read further 

„However, investors will need to look well out into the future. Think 2030 (not 2025), maybe even more. The point is not to get stuck – if you’re concerned, look even further out, say 2035! The bottom line: Alphabet is growing Waymo quickly, has the technology and competitive edge, and is addressing a potentially massive market, making this high valuation within reach“

2. Waymo will never have higher costs than Uber. The average Uber driver in the US earns $20/hour after all expenses are deducted. A year has 2080 working hours per a normal 40-hour week. That would already be a saving of $42,000 for Waymo. However, the Waymo AI driver does not have to sleep, so the vehicles will have a utilisation rate of 60-70%. Waymo easily saves $100,000 per year in operation compared to Uber. The costs for retrofitting and maintenance will be high, but are nothing compared to the savings.
Comment by DepressionMakesJerks: TLDR: No.

It's basically a advertisement company with a side job of being activist non-profit org right now. No new product for ages. 

btw, they developed the transformer tech for AI - but still don't have any useable AI product. ChatGPT, facebook, microsoft, all seem to be way ahead of google
Comment by ShadowLiberal: It also takes an absurdly long time for them to rollout Waymo to new locations, which has resulted in them doing it in very few places each year. 

Worse yet, their methodology for solving self driving is going to make it absurdly expensive for them to roll out robotaxi's that can take you anywhere in the US. And this is going to seriously limit it's potential at being anything other than a taxi service (which IMO is where only a fraction of the market value will be once full self driving is solved on a nationwide basis)
Comment by DanielBeuthner: Waymo gives 100 000 rides a week
Comment by Adept-Potato-2568: Personally, I think your thoughts are spot on but too bullish.

3-5 years to start to make a significant dent into Uber. 10-15 years to have it be more commonplace to replace a personal vehicle outside of niche early adopters

Comment by creemeeseason: UBER has a market cap of $168 billion. This argues waymo alone will be worth 50x that by next year.
Comment by DanielBeuthner: It’s not just about the rideshare market. It’s about revolutionising the transport system. First taxis and Uber and Lyft will be replaced, then second cars and at some point people will also give up their first cars. Especially in urban centres. Furthermore it’s not just about the private market, but also about commercial goods transport. Personnel costs are the highest opex cost driver. Waymo is doing away with them. This is one of the markets in which AI will show the greatest benefit, its easy to see that.
Comment by creemeeseason: 1)I read that part. Why title it 2025 if you mean 2035? It's just pointless. It instantly discredits the whole piece. 

2) waymo saves on driver expenses, but they have vehicle expenses. Those vehicles need to be purchased, fueled, insured, and maintained. That costs money. Uber doesn't have those expenses because their drivers do it out of pocket. Waymo doesn't have zero expense. 

How much does gas cost? Let's say a waymo gets 30mpg and gas is $3/gallon. If a waymo drives 100,000 miles per year they use 32,000 gallons of gas or $10,000. That's not a lot of driving for something going 24/7. Plus, maintenance. Plus, how much does a new waymo car cost to buy? That's also not a lot of miles driven.
Comment by Mysterious_Hawk7934: There are a lot of assumptions here and if any of them are off just a little this gets a whole lot lower.  Will Waymo take market share from others? Yes.  Will it add value to Google?  Yes.  But I don’t feel it’ll be even remotely what the article claims.  

I’m also interested to see what regulations will be tied to autonomous vehicles such as maintenance standards, maximum allowable age or miles/hours, insurance and other regulations they haven’t invented yet
Comment by Decent-Photograph391: Waymo is not the only player in this game. Neither is the US the only country.
Comment by DanielBeuthner: Thats too conservative. Waymo already does 100 000 rides a week. There are literally waitlists for new users. It will completly replace Uber and Lyft in the cities where the service is offered in the next 2-3 years. Why should anyone want to take a less reliable, more accident prone and more expensive car riding service?
Comment by DanielBeuthner: People on Reddit hate Alphabet. I am 50 k in, 100% of my portfolio. Alphabet is cheap af and Waymos potential gigantic. We will see who is right in 2 - 3 years.
Comment by DanielBeuthner: Please read the article and not just the title:

„However, investors will need to look well out into the future. Think 2030 (not 2025), maybe even more. The point is not to get stuck – if you’re concerned, look even further out, say 2035! The bottom line: Alphabet is growing Waymo quickly, has the technology and competitive edge, and is addressing a potentially massive market, making this high valuation within reach“
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: Sounds extremely optimistic, a bit far fetched, but most important quote a ways away
Comment by DanielBeuthner: Waymo is indeed the only player which has a functioning system on the street, giving 100 000 rides each week
Comment by Adept-Potato-2568: Because it takes time to make/get that many cars
Comment by Snight: !Remind Me 3 years
Comment by Snight: For the records, I like Alphabet as a core business. I just think you're wrong about Waymo and your entire thesis revolves around that.
Comment by SevereCar7307: !remindme 3 years

I'm not doing this to be an asshole, just curious
Comment by Bethman1995: I don't think they'll hit 7 trillion in 2-3 years but I'm also bullish on Waymo and some of their other bets long term
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: Bro, it’s your title in responding to and the bait and switch to 2030 happens in the very last paragraph. Don’t write sensational shit if you don’t want responses telling you how ridiculous it is
Comment by Decent-Photograph391: This sub doesn’t allow YouTube links.

Go to YouTube and search “CNBC China autonomous cars”

You want “functioning system on the street”? “Paying customers” maybe? Waymo has plenty of competition.

Stop assuming the US is the only player in town. Having tunnel vision is what’s going to lead to not knowing what hit you. 

Competitions from overseas are every bit as sophisticated as what Waymo is capable of, and sooner or later you’ll need to face off with them.

Is this ALL stocks in your watch list or what?
Comment by Straight_Turnip7056: Guys, give him/her/them some credit. If it's done programmatically with a script, this could be easily developed further and used to get a narrower list of "hot sto-nks" on Reddit. Feed it to a trading system (that buys PUTs or a straddle position) and you have an infinite money making machine 😁

Title : Ride-sharing giants Uber, Lyft jump after Tesla’s ‘toothless taxi’ fails to excite investors
Tesla’s hyped robotaxi unveiling posed a threat to Uber’s ride-sharing aspirations, but it has turned into a boon for the stock instead.

Uber shares had been falling on the initial investor excitement leading up to Thursday’s event — particularly slumping in early August and mid-September — but surged more than 9% on Friday on renewed enthusiasm that the company is well positioned to advance its autonomous vehicle offerings. The move pushed the stock to a 52-week high and it was leading the S&P 500 higher during the session.

That is a massive turnaround for Uber’s stock, which is now up nearly 22% over the past month and about 38% for the year. Lyft, another major player, is also surging about 10% on Friday. By comparison, Tesla’s shares are plunging during Friday’s trading session and are down more than 11% this year, vastly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, which have each gained around 22% so far this year.

The buzz around Tesla’s highly anticipated cybercab has largely dissipated due to a lack of detail on its latest full self-driving technology advancements and the company’s failure to provide insight on its ride-sharing service strategy or economics, among other expectations investors had.

“TSLA’s toothless taxi is a best-case outcome for UBER,” Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni said in a Friday note, noting that the electric car maker provided ambitious targets but little signs of feasibility.

Comment by notreallydeep: Someone asked me a few days ago how much I'd bet against Tesla and I said $0. Turns out my Uber long position was a huge bet against Tesla...

The more you know. And praise Elon for that gain.
Comment by Humble_Increase7503: Uber is not a competitor of Tesla.

This entire pairs trade is asinine.

It was dumb when Uber sold off 7 months ago, as a result of this cyber taxi bs being announced, and it was dumb when it pumped when cyber taxi event was bs.

Wall Street loves a dumb fuck narrative, and this is one of them. 

Disclosure: I have both; but more uber. I’m heavily loaded to the tits in Uber leaps that I’m up massive amounts in.
Comment by Slim_Margins1999: I had $232.50 puts I paid $300 for. I sold them for a small profit Thursday because I was scared. Turns out they would have been 500% profit for the entire day Friday if I’d held. They went as high as $1800 a contract
Comment by Smipims: Elmo needs to go

i don't really see the need for this.
Comment by wenchanger: if I was a girl I would rather sit in the robotaxi than to risk getting hit on by a perverted/sleazy Uber Driver
Comment by __Evil-Genius__: TSLZ. Two times inverse leveraged Telsa up 17% on Friday. This puppy has been on my watchlist. Might run all week next week.

Comment by None: [deleted]
Comment by spanishdictlover: The obvious astro-turfing of hate on Tesla and Elon the past 48 hours is ridiculous over multiple subs. Typical reddit behavior. C'mon MODs.
Comment by Veqq: A dozen+ Chinese companies: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/business/china-driverless-cars.html They've been running like Waymo for over 2 years. Go to y o u t u b e and you'll see 5 year old videos about autonomous buses, street sweepers etc. also. (The sub auto deletes video links)
Comment by TechnicianExtreme200: Zoox, but they're not public yet
Comment by notreallydeep: Cruise, I think. They suspended operations a while ago but went online again recently, but again, "I think".
Comment by SuperTimmyH: No one literally. And even Waymo is unlikely expand nationally in a fast expansion due to its high cost of adoptions. In other works, autonomous driving still years away.
Comment by MisterrTickle: Mercedes on their $200,000+ range, +$5,000 per year, only works on a very limited number of stretches of highways.
Comment by hewkii2: There’s not a lot of value for the end customer in autonomous taxis in and of themselves. That’s why other taxi equivalents are being compared against.
Comment by RaymondAblack: Waymo has cameras, lidar and radar and still can’t drive straight 

Teslas only use cameras. They can never be true self driving cars
Comment by WickedSensitiveCrew: I'm buying UBER. I think it has Way Mo upside as well. The risk seems to be dipping. You buy UBER it is a bet they become the platform robotaxis get their rides off of. All you need is robotaxi competition. 

But I totally get this thread will turn into a Google thread with how much popular Google is to UBER/LYFT which the article in OP is about.
Comment by MisterrTickle: Goog is on the verge of being broken up, by the DoJ due to monopolistic behavior.
Comment by thehumbleguy: Yeah i think at this point it is a meme stock for traders.
Comment by Hanneee: Ok now explain to me how a functioning Tesla Robotaxi wouldn't challenge Uber's market position?
Comment by d33p7r0ubl3: Whats your bull thesis on uber
Comment by mowngle: This is a weird hypothetical.  The drivers have rankings, they’re not going to be able to drive for Uber for very long if they’re hitting on their customers.
Comment by El_Chipi_Barijho: Uber isn't "Fake Taxi"
Comment by TommyBlaze13: It's been 10 years since Elon began talking about FSD. 

[Tesla FSD Timeline ](https://motherfrunker.ca/fsd/)

He has a history of this.

December 2020
"I'm extremely confident that Tesla will have level five next year, extremely confident, 100%"

Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight
Comment by ZucchiniNo2986: It'll age by Elon saying it's still 2-3 years away like he always does
Comment by Full_Boysenberry_314: Lack of firm timelines to launch. Ambiguous status on regulatory approval.

Financial estimates for cost to run these things felt like Elon was making them up on the spot, there was no evidence of real analysis there.

Could have tried explaining the design decisions for the taxi. Why 2 seats? Is there a variant with more? 

I'm not an Elon hater. I think the meme-hating on the guy here is cringy AF and kind of childish. And, I was excited for the robotaxi event. But it did not really deliver in my opinion.
Comment by maximusprime2328: I saw a video of someone who actually got to ride in one. They drove in a one block loop and they were in a traffic jam. They're nowhere near road tested. Google has been testing on the road for years. Even before waymo
Comment by Rossoneri: Well he’s been lying about the capability of his self driving tech for well on a decade now. When you’re never going to deliver on your promises they become toothless and we’ve seen no indication that Tesla can deliver
Comment by WhatIsHerJob-TABLES: Maybe Elon shouldn’t have lost public trust by cozying up to white supremacists on his platform, giving them a voice, and constantly spewing hate and bigotry on the platform he has completely destroyed all good will from. 

Actions have consequences. His shitty actions have led people to stop believing in his rhetoric and to stop investing in his companies. Those are his consequences. If you want to whine about it, you can feel free to flock to ex-twitter with all the other hateful bigots spewing bullshit left and right. 

Investors are no longer fooled by his grand gestures and ideas. We see through his grifting nonsense and see him just as another lackey pushing bullshit.
Comment by notic: Hundreds of millions worth of bets were placed as soon the market opened, it’s not just Reddit, there’s very few people left to believe his fantasies given his track record and it seems like they’ll unfortunately watch their investments decline
Comment by TheCoStudent: Isnt ZooX an amazon venture?
Comment by MisterrTickle: Isnt GM gutting it?  Mainly due to them covering up that they knocked over a pedestrian and then dragged them along the street.  So the regulator is spitting blood.
Comment by pargofan: High cost of adoption?  If this were true, then why were Tesla investors so excited about the prospect?
Comment by sarhoshamiral: Both numbers are wrong. They have it on 2024 EQS Sedan which is around ~125k but that's before any discounts which it has plenty. Annual fee is also 2500$.

Having said that if I was in California, I would have still waited to buy it because it is fairly limited right now mainly to be used when there is heavy traffic on highways and flow is under 40mph but Mercedes' level 2 does a decent job on that anyway. Once they enable it for full highway speed then it may be a different story.,
Comment by 16semesters: > Waymo has cameras, lidar and radar and still can’t drive straight
> 
> 

Waymo is far superior statistically to human drivers when it comes to reported crashes, injuries, and insurance claims.

Luddites are the only people claiming that Waymo isn't a good driver.
Comment by bartturner: Waymo is now doing well over 100,000 rides a week.

That is not happening unless you can drive straight.
Comment by TheINTL: Have you been inside a Waymo? I doubt it
Comment by Quintevion: We use only 2 eyes. Why would 10 cameras in all directions never be enough?
Comment by Trademinatrix: Can you break down how exactly Uber plans to dominate this long term? Like, what about them gives them a bigger upside to Google? I know they have a very big platform, but Google being Google, they can easily catch up and accelerate their own, at which point, what would be Uber’s unique competitiveness in this field? I’m genuinely curious.
Comment by pargofan: Why would Google need Uber? In SF people are using the Waymo app pretty readily.  Eventually, it'll virtually replace Uber altogeether
Comment by redditmod: Watch the value skyrocket
Comment by TheINTL: 1. You can't say that with 100% certainty. If that's your approach to investing than you should 150% stick to index funds.

2. If they get broken up that could be a good thing. Being a shareholder you will be entitled to all the split up company's shares.
Comment by totallyclocks: Ya, end?

It that happens that you as a shareholder are going to get shares in multiple very competitive companies which are all going to seek to become huge.

And the big cash cow companies like Search would be given an insane valuation as it doesn’t have to invest in moonshot projects and can instead pay a fantastic dividend.

Google getting broken up would suck for Google Management, but it would be a huge boon to investors
Comment by Bic_wat_u_say: DOJ logic : let’s break up google during the most competitive point for search even and LLM introduction
Comment by After-Imagination-96: Google will acquire the DOJ
Comment by bartturner: A broken up Google is worth a lot more money than on intact.

But with that said.

There is next to zero chance Google will be broken up.

Comment by Humble_Increase7503: Because Uber doesn’t manufacture vehicles. 

They’re a ride sharing and food delivery app with hundreds of millions of users, but they rely on others to provide the vehicle.

Tesla manufacturers vehicles.

It’s just entirely speculative to suggest Tesla will compete with Uber.

Indeed, their businesses are symbiotic. Uber would be infinitely more profitable if the rides were autonomous. 

It seems like a huge assumption to believe Tesla will, some day, roll out a fully autonomous vehicle, and then also roll out a ride sharing app?

Why do they even need to do that?

Why not just manufacture the vehicle and make a deal with Uber and take x% of any ride? 

Not to mention, it’s entirely unknown when tesla autonomous driving will happen, and it’s also not a foregone conclusion that ONLY Tesla will be able to develop it. See e.g. waymo.

Realistically, even if Tesla did want to enter into the ride sharing market, whenever that was to occur, Uber would be able to partner with one of Tesla’s competitors, and leverage their massive install base.
Comment by Humble_Increase7503: They they keep earning more money.

They’re the dominant player in ride sharing and food delivery and that won’t stop anytime soon.

Eventually they’ll be doing robo taxi as well but it’s a whatever issue for me at this point.

Nobody is even close with autonomous driving so idc ab that.

I do think they’ll be a better player in that than TSLA
Comment by reddit-abcde: uber is at ATH now, no point buying it now
Comment by wenchanger: well idk but it happened to my friend that a driver asked for her number but she had to politely but uncomfortably say No
Comment by TheINTL: Yes, Zoox is part of Amazon
Comment by notreallydeep: Apparently they're about to start: [https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gms-cruise-begin-testing-autonomous-vehicles-california-2024-09-19/](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gms-cruise-begin-testing-autonomous-vehicles-california-2024-09-19/)

So I was wrong, but GM is also not gutting them (unless there's something more recent I'm unaware of).
Comment by thememanss: Because they believe a conman conning them.  
Comment by SuperTimmyH: Huh, why Tesla investors would be excited about Waymo. I was talking about Waymo’s high cost of adaption.
Comment by carrera4s: For Tesla the cost of adoption would be very low.  Every Tesla that is currently on the road is fully equipped to operate as a robotaxi.
Comment by RaymondAblack: “luddites” 😂😂

Did you learn a new word and feel special?

All I’ve been buying are electric or plug in hybrid cars for the last 8 years and I get a new car every other year. I must really hate new tech 🙄🙄

Maybe I’m just a guy who lives in an area with a lot of Waymos, realizes that they’re designed to “learn” people’s drivings skills, and have firsthand seen them do stupid shit 🤷‍♂️
Comment by RaymondAblack: And they’re avoiding certain streets and on go on the freeway in San Francisco why? If they’re truly self driving why not give them the ability to drive everywhere? Why are they only in a couple cities? Since their sensors are so amazing and they’re clearly not on digital tracks. You’re just listening to information from the very company that would obviously just give you good news 😂
Comment by NoDiscussion9873: We also use hearing, risk awareness & perception and intuition that allows us spot potential hazards and preemptively act. 

This is of course missing for cameras and why I think as many other guiding elements like lidar are a good idea.
Comment by bartturner: Birds have wings that flap and planes do not.

Same reason.
Comment by WickedSensitiveCrew: My investment thesis isnt for Uber to dominate robo car industry. Just like Uber was never dominating the regular car industry. They just have to be the platform that facilitates these rides. As I said in comment all you need is for there to be robotaxi competition. 

Google being Google isnt enough if there are 10 different companies offering robotaxis in the world. However if Google is the only one then yea Uber would be screwed. But I think the safer bet is to assume their wont be a monopoly where one company owns all the robo taxis.

I think you have to go to a Google vs Tesla thread for a thread where holes being poked at Waymo is more accepted. I cant really go into more detail in an Uber vs Google thread. People love Google more than Uber.
Comment by WickedSensitiveCrew: That hinges on Google having a monopoly on robo taxis. I said in my post investing in Uber is a bet that there will be multiple companies with robotaxis that they become like regular cars such as GM, Ford, Chrysler, etc with intense competition.

Waymo is just a small part of Google business that if that happens they have other ways to make money. But in a thread about robotaxis that is something that needs to be considered.
Comment by himynameis_: Takes a lot of capital investment to build out a fleet of cars. 

Easier/cheaper to lease the tech out and keep the data.
Comment by MisterrTickle: Except that it loses the connection between search, mobile, chrome and advertising.   With advertising being the most important part but relies on the others.
Comment by MisterrTickle: But thou end up losing the connection between advertising and the rest of the company.  

With Google just being a very fancy advertising company.  Which relies on other services to deliver ads.
Comment by d33p7r0ubl3: Im not. Just curious why people are so bullish on it
Comment by MisterrTickle: About to resume

>On Oct. 2 [2023], a pedestrian in San Francisco hit by another vehicle was thrown into the path of a self-driving Cruise car and dragged 20 feet (6 m).

>In the aftermath, California suspended the company's permit for driverless vehicles, and Cruise pulled all its U.S. self-driving vehicles from testing. The unit's then-CEO, Kyle Vogt, and co-founder Dan Kan resigned in November.

Followed by a wave of GM ordered cuts to Cruise.  900 jobs/25%.

>Cruise’s troubles can be traced to an Oct. 2 crash when a car hit a woman at an intersection in San Francisco and flung her into the path of one of Cruise’s driverless taxis.

Regulators accused Cruise of omitting footage of its car dragging the woman from a video that it provided to state officials.

Comment by Inglourious-Ape: Every Tesla that is on the road today is fully equipped to maime and kill passengers and pedestrians as a robotaxi. As a Tesla owner who has used FSD for hundreds of drives, I don't believe the current vision only hardware can ever be safe enough for fully autonomous driving. Rain, direct low horizon sunlight, and night time have made FSD make some sketchy AF decisions that I don't think will improve on HWD3 or HWD4 in the coming years.
Comment by bartturner: Same reason that they did the 10/10 event on a back lot of a movie studio.  FSD is not safe to use for anything beyond that simple track.

Waymo does vigorous testing to make sure it is safe before being deployed.
Comment by pargofan: I'd be shocked if Waymo is not a huge bet for Google. They're not stupid. They see the same potential that you and I do. 

Just because they have other businesses doesn't mean they're not putting a big bet on Waymo.  It only means they can allocate more resources and handle failure better.
Comment by None: [deleted]
Comment by reddit-abcde: uber is partnering with waymo to offer autonomous rides
Comment by notreallydeep: They're still starting up again this year from what I can gather, that's all I'm saying 🤷‍♂️
Comment by RaymondAblack: Yeah, they would never lie so they can get their product on the road and start making money. Never! The cars are perfect!!

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBUNLNZRtT8/

Why are you glazing Waymo? You work there or you really trust companies when they put out press releases? They’re all over my neighborhood and they make stupid decisions everytime I see them. Just because people like me are avoiding them so they’re not getting in accidents every ride doesn’t mean they’re safe lmao
Comment by WickedSensitiveCrew: This goes back to my original comment. Other companies see this potential too. I dont think Google will be the only company with robo taxis. If other companies create robotaxis the question becomes does Uber need Google. But that question cant be asked since threads only last 24 hours. We wont know until at least 2025 when Cruise starts rolling out robotaxis.

Im not sure why so many think robotaxis will be a monopoly. Do people really think rest of world going to sit back and let Google get all those profits.
Comment by MisterrTickle: Google could stop paying Apple.  Apple has said thst they were offered the entiriety of Bing for free and still didn't take it, as it's just so far behind Google.  

I'm not quite sure how Maps and Street view helps Google's bottom line.  Apart from knowing where their customers live, go to work etc.  But  it's one of the factors that means that they know more about you and feeds into how well they can target and measure ads.  Their primary source of income is advertising whethether that's through Ad-Sense or through sponsored search.  Breaking Google up, reduces their ability to collect that data.
Comment by WickedSensitiveCrew: Yea. That Cruise news is from 2023. Users may need to update their news to 2024. 

Uber is partnered with Cruise

They are amazing.   But Google/Waymo did their first on public roads, rider, only, nine years ago!

Title : 
Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress
Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event — where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm’s Cybercab self-driving concept car — failed to impress investors.

Tesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.

Musk revealed Tesla’s Cybercab concept vehicle — a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals — on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.

The Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.

He also said he expects Tesla to have “unsupervised FSD” up and running in Texas and California next year in the company’s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla’s premium driver assistance system, available today in a “supervised” version for Tesla electric vehicles.

The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

In reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous driving future.

“As expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla’s growth endeavors in AI/AV \[autonomous vehicles\],” Barclays’ U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.

“Yet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn’t show its low-cost model planned for 1H′25 production,” they added. “We also didn’t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.”

Piper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that “most trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.”

“We wouldn’t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,” the investment bank’s analysts said in the note.

Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank’s analysts noted that Musk didn’t mention any details on improvements to Tesla’s FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk’s AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports.

The event “overall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote in a note Friday.

“We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event,” they added.

It is expected to take some years still before self-driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads, with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles.

Among the few companies that have successfully launched self-driving cars on public roads is Google’s Waymo, which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June.Comment by notreallydeep: Ah, good reminder to update my timeline.

Comment by ankole_watusi: It’s a concept of a plan!
Comment by jaywin91: Meme stock, meme CEO, meme products
Comment by Kimchipotato87: The event was just a "nothing burger" as this event was his pure fantasy and not possible to go public in the near future. Even other traditional carmakers could have arranged such events.
Comment by stickman07738: There is no way in hell that he will gets approval for FSD in 2025 in TX and CA.   He still has issues with NTSB and he will need to show accident rates will decrease to below humans.  The big stumble blocks will be what happens when AI and or cameras go down.
Comment by virgo911: That Robovan was so embarrasing. Why are they so against making a regular ass electric bus. A bus is better in every way than that thing. Bigger, can have a bathroom, you don’t have to fucking face someone else during your ride, it has more than 1 inch of ground clearance, etc. 

He started talking about moving sports teams around and I almost laughed out loud in my living room. Buses have been moving sports teams for a century and they’re not getting replaced. It’s like Tesla is the child in Babadook. Why can’t you just be NORMAL?

Not only that, he didn’t really list any useful things for Optimus to do.

Laundry? Dishes? Cleaning? Not mentioned.

Playing… games? Being your “friend”? Yeah he talked about that, because people are going to pay $30k for a robot to play rock paper scissors with and listen to their problems. He’s too out of touch to be doing this anymore.

All you need to know about this clown is in 2019 he gave it 1-1.5 years to have, quote: “a million robotaxis on the road”. 5 years later and we still only have a concept of a plan.

This guy has been cooked ever since he sabotaged high speed rail in California for his failed Hyperloop venture, which was ridiculous from the start. Yeah, it’s totally feasible to maintain hundreds of miles of tubes at a complete vacuum in one of the most Earthquake centric zones on the planet. Fucking idiot.
Comment by AlwaysATM: Lmao well deserved. And it’s gonna be a double whammy with earnings in late October. I see this going below 200 again
Comment by jaguaraugaj: Get your ass to Mars
Comment by parkway_parkway: What a turd of an event. 

I'm expecting a 20% drop in the stock. 

They used literal smoke and mirrors to try to disguise the fact that all they did was push the timelines back a couple of years. 

They havent put any effort into thinking through the operational reality of running a robotaxi network, waymo are years ahead. 

And the bot is kind of a cool gimmick and saying "oh it'll look after your kids" just shows a frankly childish level of delusion and unwillingness to actually think about what it could uselessly do. 

Pathetic.

Comment by Adventurous-Bet-9640: Some good news for $RIVN 🤪
Comment by FistEnergy: No steering wheel or pedals, so there is no way to take over when the system glitches or bricks, or there is an internet connectivity outage, or road/weather conditions are so bad that the system cannot handle it. Great.

Why is this stock priced ridiculously higher than the other car companies again? It's just hot air and empty promises of "Someday Trust Me Bro"
Comment by TheGoonKills: It was so nice of Elon to build short buses just for his followers
Comment by im_a_stapler: Another hyped up, underwhelming Musk product.  Not surprised.  Can Elon just fade into oblivion now?  I know that will never happen, but fuck that guy a million times over.
Comment by James_Vowles: they don't have the hype to do these fake vapourware events anymore
Comment by CptIskarJarak: The 30k price point tells us something. He is lumping the robotaxi and sub 30k cheap ev car into one project. Not sure if it’s good or bad.
Comment by ZeroWashu: I look at it this way.  
  
Given that nothing in this presentation is supposed to be available before 2026 and all products were shown are not capable of being driven and as such it pretty much tells many that Tesla has no intention of expanding their offering in replacing traditional vehicles. There is no smaller model Y that many hoped for and two seat vehicles have some of the lowest numbers among traditional cars.
  
However the real issue is that they made it clear only current HW4 vehicle will have true FSD and that all previous generations will not.  Elon actually deflected that very question.  This can possibly open them up to being sued by customers and stock holders.
Comment by Ap3X_GunT3R: Jfc 

I have an idea. Maybe give the CEO another $50 billion so he can buy another social media company
Comment by MarshallGrover: Even ChatGPT is not impressed:  
  
"Looks like the Cybercab's promise of self-driving independence hit a speed bump! Investors were expecting autopilot, not a bumper sticker of aspirations. Maybe next time, Elon should include a ‘steering wheel’ option for confidence—at least it’ll give shareholders something to hold onto while waiting for that *real* ride-sharing revolution! 🚗💨 #Tesla #Robotaxi"
Comment by tom-slacker: Musk: our newly announced*insert model name* will be available next year.


Said Elon Musk since 2019.....while missing deadline every year. 🤣

Comment by Marcusnovus: Why I sold my stake with a small profit and never looking back. Sick of TSLA and it's bipolar prices
Comment by FantasyFrikadel: Tesla stock always responds to events like this because it’s heavily traded on rumors and news.

Investors take time to digest the information. We’ll know in a week if there is enthusiasm for these plans or not.

Personally I wasn’t impressed with the timeline or the vehicles. The company was once an innovator but is now just trying to replicate a dystopian Pail Verhoven  future.

Comment by osoptimizer: The tech might not have wowed the market as much as people hoped, and the reaction seems to reflect some skepticism about its immediate potential. It’s a reminder that even big reveals from companies like Tesla aren’t guaranteed to impress everyone. Curious to see how they bounce back from this.
Comment by Similar_Resort8300: hahahaaa musk the magat

Comment by GeneralZaroff1: It’s down 8.5% now.
Comment by 1baby2cats: If it still requires a human behind ready to brake/steer at any time, is it really self driving?  People using it are not going to be paying attention, how will they brake/steer in an emergency?
Comment by ilikebunnies1: I knew I should have bought 0DTE puts.
Comment by welmoe: Overpromise, underdeliver.
Comment by Malamonga1: So if a 2 seater cannot even go under 30k, there's no way Elon's keeping that promise on the 25k car right?
Comment by saposapot: Does this cybercab mean the cheap EV will probably also be a 2 seater?
Comment by RocketLabBeatsSpaceX: Typical Elon vaporware to siphon more money from the masses.

Comment by OneMadChihuahua: This event and the exodus of high level staff before the event tells you all you need to know.
Comment by bluemofo: Priced in
Comment by futurespacecadet: They took out the steering wheel, so even if you buy a Robo taxi for yourself to do trips, you can’t use it as your own car. You’d have to pay for your own trips?

At least make a steering wheel that gets recessed into the dashboard and locks there .

Or at least go full autonomous vehicle and make a car that doesnt have to look like a car, where are the seats can spin in face each other and it’s like a people mover…. But not like the van because that design is hideous.
Comment by Forward_Collar2559: WTF, all he had to do was slap this technology on existing Trolley platforms to create a mini renaissance in public transit. It would have immediately tapped into the public sense of nostalgia so hard that every shopping center and church would pay to have a few parking spaces specifically devoted for pick-up and drop off. His incessant need to place is mark on everything seems to be a quiet weakness. Sure, these are fun, would have been far more efficacious to bring back trolley lines with EV technology. Would be much safer and require less trust on the part of the user.  His chosen platform will have to operate at a loss to encourage expendable test pilots, I mean ridership.
Comment by Cjdx: Musk is trying to use products to show off revolutionary technology, instead of using revolutionary technology to develop revolutionary products. How is that robotaxi going to revolutionize transportation?

Comment by Fukitol_shareholder: Which insurance company is going to accept this? in case of an accident between 2 FSD...? Who is accountable? is it necessary a driver license to buy a FSD?
Comment by GovernmentThis4895: Both products seem ridiculous as they were displayed. The van looks like a toaster and why doesn’t the cab have a wheel if also being sold to consumers… people want the options. 

In 2026 we will not be in cars with no steering broadly.
Comment by AdvantagePast2484: I stopped following Teslas product in 2022 after they fell off and stopped innovating, it looks like Tesla is going downhill. I'll share my first impressions.

Seeing the robotaxi on Reddit just looked like a parade float, no idea if it's for public transportation or a private vehicle? It looked clumsy and weird with very confusing amounts of LED lights.

The robots look less like they shit their pants when they walk, but ultimately still slow and unimpressive seeing them just walk. Honda did that 20 years ago, so they gotta pump the gas a bit. I would divest immediately if I saw this as a shareholder.
Comment by Impressive_Good_8247: I imagine a world where Tesla is free of dumb maga Elon and can finally use the better designs not hindered by this dip shits ego. That van was a colossal embarrassment. Who designs a van with no suspension travel and no ability to pass over bumps without being damaged?
Comment by JustTheOneGoose22: If Tesla really got their self driving technology downpat, then a reliable taxi service just using an autonomous Model S or X would be impressive enough to gain investment.

Instead Elon went full Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow and made another hideous cyber punk monstrosity that nobody asked for or wanted.
Comment by WhosAfraidOf_138: Good. This guy needs to stop promising shit that won't come true
Comment by No-Storage2900: 

Wouldn’t go near the stock with a 10 foot pole. I am still butthurt about the meme dollars that were made, though. 

“Unsupervised fsd” is still a nothing burger imo. The tech is there, but nothing else is. The infrastructure of a lot of American towns prohibits safe fsd as it operates right now and the need is there, but we are still a long way off from wide and realistic adoption.

Yet another one of the wild promises that were never going to come to fruition.
Comment by Sea-Zucchini-5891: The fact that it is $30k for a two-seat TAXI seems like an exceptionally bad idea. I haven't ridden in a taxi with less than 3 people in like 4 years.
Comment by BrotherTraditional45: What would happen if eventually 75% of cars had robotic vision (360°) and shared the information they gather and process in real time? There would essentially be 1,000s of nearby cameras/sensors working in unison to aid your auto.

Comment by bartturner: I was really surprised just how bad the event ended up being.

Not just the fact it started an hour late.   I could look past that.

It was like they copied the script from a Google/Waymo event over 8 years ago.  Same talking points.

I am actually not completely convinced that Tesla really wants to do a robot taxi service.  

I watch the money.   I can't see any material investment going independently into a robot taxi service.

No permits.  No trials.   The FSD software seems to be a lot more about selling cars than a robot taxi service.

Which does work.  I purchased a Tesla only to play with FSD.  I would not have purchased a Tesla without FSD.

But I live half time US and half time Thailand.   Here in Thailand there is no FSD and I need a car and leaning towards getting a BYD Seal.   But if there was FSD here in Thailand I would get the Tesla.

As a consumer would you rather ride in a professionally operated, insured, and trained robotaxi from Google? Or would you like to ride in a total stranger's car with no Lidar, and the stranger could've made all sorts of modifications to the car without your knowledge? What if the stranger is a stalker and retains a tracker to your house? What if the car has cameras to steal your personal information?

I would pick Waymo every single time.

Comment by owner_712: Some news said this taxi still only has cameras and nothing else?

In this case we are simply left with the question if Elon's ego is just going to lose him a lot of money, or also a lot of other Tesla shareholders in addition, who still believe Elon's self-driving architecture is the best ever.

A lidar might cost money, but double checking the camera data with a second measurement mode is an absolute no-brainer if you move that much mass with 55 mph through a Country-side displaying bill-board.
Comment by Employee28064212: I'm struggling to understand why the boards of these companies keep Elon at the top. TSLA and Twitter have both become so incredibly volatile and it's just largely because of who he is. Robot cars are going to look a little silly no matter who is presenting them, but Elon Musk is a tool. If he were just another rank and file CEO unveiling a product, people would probably either invest or hold until profits.

Comment by headshotmonkey93: But…but…but…their FSD is decades ahead?!?!?!? lol
Comment by gymbeaux4: Tesla the auto manufacturer is worth maybe $10/share. Tesla the “we’re doing **stuff** with AI” company is worth $???/share. So like with NVDA clueless investors are mashing the buy button- and it’ll work… until it doesn’t. The music will stop and the share prices will tank. 

It will take probably years, but eventually the shareholders of TSLA will realize they were sold a bill of goods. Lots of talk about the “potential” of AI, not a lot of action. FSD is harder than most humans can imagine. Most humans, most TSLA shareholders, have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA how to train a machine learning model to drive a car. They falsely believe that “hey Tesla is close, it already kind of drives itself, how much farther can FSD be?”

In the world of data science and machine learning, getting a model to be “right” about 80% of the time is relatively easy. This “80% accuracy” target is often good enough. It’s okay if the ML model is wrong 20 or even 30% of the time- for example, when I go to the dentist for my 6-month cleaning, my dentist has this AI dental thing look at my X-Rays and point out “potential problem areas”. Last time I went, it found around 6 “problem areas”- now I’ve been seeing this dentist for almost a decade, he’s never had to do a filling or any other restorative work, I use a Sonicare toothbrush, etc. So as you can guess, he looks at all the problem areas and writes them off. Basically a “thanks for the help, AI, but everything’s okay!” He explained that it’s nice to have a “second set of eyes” but he of course doesn’t trust it to make any decisions.

ChatGPT is similar. It’s wrong a lot. Hard to put a percentage figure on it but I would say as someone who uses it daily, it’s wrong AT LEAST 20% of the time. This is also fine, as it has disclaimers everywhere, even in some of its responses saying “hey man I could be wrong.”

On the other hand, for use-cases where even being wrong 2% of the time is unacceptable, as with *driving a fucking car*, relying solely on AI is, currently, impossible. I’m not aware of anything- be it cars, robots performing surgery, or those bullshit “Optimus” robots- that is accurate enough to not need a human monitoring it. 

This is why Tesla says not to nap while your car is in autopilot mode on the interstate. The interstate is, as AI driving software goes, the easiest “test” of abilities. Minimal traffic signs, roads are large and relatively straight, no pedestrians… I would guess for this ideal scenario, Tesla’s self-driving machine learning model is 90%+ “accurate”. This is where you’re least likely to die from sleeping in your Tesla while it’s driving. Still a nonzero chance you’ll die, but relatively low. 

But FSD stands for *full* self-driving, so it **must** be able to deal with city driving- pedestrians, school zones, windy roads, stop signs, other drivers driving unpredictably… this is MANY times more difficult than teaching a computer to drive on an interstate highway. I would describe it as something like 100x more difficult. It’s not just a little more difficult- this is where I think most TSLA shareholders are naively speculating on Tesla The AI Company.

And of course there are many other companies competing with Tesla in this space. Not just Wemo. I can go on the internet and for a thousand bucks buy a device that hooks up to my “dumb” car’s computer and will give it similar self-driving capabilities to Teslas. Identical if I recall correctly. Neither than truly “FSD”, but… the point is, here’s proof that teaching a computer to drive on the interstate is EASY- so many other companies can do it. The one I’m thinking of is Comma AI https://comma.ai/ 


**I’m a software engineer who trains machine learning models for a living. I probably know more than anyone else here about how realistic FSD is**

Where it gets tricky is the stock play. Stocks can remain irrational longer than most people can remain solvent… so while I personally am convinced TSLA is overpriced vaporware, it could rally to $1000/share before the rest of the world comes to the same conclusion. There’s also the possibility that Elon continues to “stall” successfully until they really do figure out FSD- to be clear, I think FSD will happen eventually. I also think Tesla will announce they have solved FSD long before they actually do, release it, and we’ll eventually see some deadly failures in the real-world akin to Boeing’s MCAS on the 737 MAX. I have no doubt in my mind Tesla will release a defective FSD calling it “perfect”, and then people will die, they’ll recall it, the stock will tank as it’s done many times before, people go back to betting on “the future of AI”, rinse, repeat. 

So yeah, I’ve been playing with the stock market for over a decade. Mixed success of course. My opinion is that TSLA will remain very volatile until a competitor figures out true FSD. I don’t see how current technology will actually facilitate a 99-100% accurate ML model for city driving. I see this as being over a decade away. I will be VERY skeptical of any claims of FSD from Tesla or anyone else prior to that. In the meantime, playing off those Elon Tweets and fake Optimus robot demos will be tricky. I think there’s lot of money to be made for those who successfully navigate the spikes and dips of TSLA over the next decade.

Comment by StayPositive001: If I was Elon I would just bite the bullet. No Tesla on the road is a robotaxi. Release HW5 with lidar, and have it Geofenced to cities and local municipals where it will be easier to get approvals. They'll be sued and fined but if the true real end goal is self driving, then this is the fastest way. They can continue to develop generalized FSD concurrently.

Comment by MisterrTickle: Other traditional car makers would have done a far better job.  

Tesla "Full Self Driving" is SAE Level 2 or partially automated driving.  

Waymo and Mercedes have up to Level 4 highly automated.  Which means that human interference in the driving is hardly needed.  Tesla did a demonstration of a Tesla cab in San Fransisco a few months ago.  With an employee behind the wheel.  Who was continually having to correct the "Autopilot", otherwise it was just simply going to crash.
Comment by ZeroWashu: well what I saw was that Tesla may have given up on the lower cost traditional vehicle market which is big if true. they also admitted FSD 3 equipped cars will not have FSD.  Oh, the hopes people had for a work van were completely dashed.
Comment by Sanhen: > not possible to go public in the near future

Which is wild because Waymo already exists. Even if Tesla announced that their self-driving cars were being released tomorrow, they wouldn't be first to market.

Comment by Dingens25: >Why can’t you just be NORMAL?

Because normal companies making normal cars or busses exist. And they're valued at a fair price considering their current product portfolio and financial performance. 

Musk and Tesla need to keep the scam going that at some point in the future they will reinvent transportation, because otherwise even the fanboys will start comparing them to VW, Toyota or Ford and notice a slight discrepancy in valuation.

Comment by m0nk_3y_gw: 6 months ago TSLA went from $200 to $140 when Elon said he was betting the company on RoboTaxi.

Then there was earnings and it was back at $250 within 1-2 months.

Comment by virgo911: Not sure how they expected any hype out of this when nearly everything they’re advertising as ‘the future’ Waymo is already doing in Arizona.

Also I genuinely could not believe he didn’t mention more useful chores for Optimus to do. He mentioned playing games and being your friend. 

The FIRST thing someone is going to want a robot to do is the boring stuff. He needs to hammer the words laundry, dishes, vacuuming, cleaning, etc. in his head if he wants anyone to be excited about this, but unfortunately he’s far too out of touch to be considering those peasant activities.
Comment by branyk2: The robotics thing just showcases the lack of vision. Marching out a robot that does nothing but one day promises to do everything is way less impressive than showing a robot that has a single use case that people can immediately and intuitively understand.

Watching a giant arm attached to wheels stack heavy boxes, I can see the future. Watching a humanoid wobble onto a stage and do nothing is just a vision of a very rich nerdy sci-fi fan.

Comment by Time_Astronaut: >RIVN bagholder 
Comment by ShadowLiberal: Tesla is hardly the only one to do that. GM/Cruise and Waymo have both done it, and so have countless others trying to make self driving vehicles.

IMO it should illegal under Federal law for them to make vehicles without a steering wheel/etc. until it's been proven and certified by the government to be safe driving anywhere in the US without any human intervention. You're just asking a whole heap of trouble otherwise. The government should be protecting people from such dangerous experimentation on public roads with no emergency override safety measures. And I'm saying this as someone who fully believes that they'll eventually solve self driving.

It'd be like an airplane company working on anti-gravity boots to replace the parachute deciding that even though their anti-gravity boots don't work yet, they don't need to put parachutes in their planes anymore since the boots kind of work when you're dozens of feet off the ground.

It's not like it's selling AI chips like Nvidia where it's profit margin per chip sold is off the charts to the moon (for now anyway)...

A frakkin car company, where it's profit margin is questionable, where its outreach limited (I don't drive so Tesla products are non-existent to me), where it has zero chance to bring to make it in china, where most people's upgrade cycle is 5+ years on average and thus will not have consistent annual revenue stream, etc....

Comment by 007meow: My understanding - which I’d love to be corrected if wrong - is that Elon really pushed for the Blade Runner design
Comment by krsaxor: Dont forget the cyber van or whatever that thing is. Im still not sure if it looked like a toaster or a stapler.
Comment by Sanhen: > They need to fire all the designers. 

Elon Musk is probably the one picking/directing the design. Firing the designers won't help if this is what Musk wants them to design.
Comment by TY5ieZZCfRQJjAs: They need to fire Elon. 

He's the one who's green-lighting and promoting all of these stupid projects (Robotaxi, Cybervan, Cybertruck, CyberATV, Next-Gen Tesla Roadster, Tesla Semi, etc..)

Comment by TPGNutJam: One bump or pothole and that cars done
Comment by greenpride32: The invitation for the event had a huge camera lens on it.  So I wasn't expecting anything more.  My thoughts are they're not going to get that license to robotaxi in CA or TX next year.
Comment by elonzucks: well, it sort of doesn't matter, because it doesn't exist.
Comment by THICC_DICC_PRICC: They’ve been saying they’re going vision only for years, nobody expected extra sensors. Elon has been pretty clear about that
Comment by Suspicious-Coffee20: Exactly. Is whole argument is driver can drive with only their eye. Thats not even true since we got gyro, and hearings but they are also supposed to be better than human. Hence the need for lidar and radar.


Waymo as the right idea and it's why they are actually approved. 
Comment by Visco0825: It didn’t help that the event started at midnight on the east coast.  But it does seem like investors are wising up.  It’s just wild how much trust has been burned up by Elon.  You can’t trust that these taxis will come out when they do.  You can’t trust that these taxis that he’s demoing aren’t actually driving themselves.  You can’t trust that the robots are automated.  You can’t trust his comments about FSD.  

Yes, Elon won the race for a fully EV fleet but it’s been 4 years since the explosion of Tesla stock and they have been struggling since.

In Teslas defense, I don’t think it’s fully just a Tesla thing.  Facebook and Apple coming out with these “smart” glasses is just more shit from tech companies that no body wants and it’s just a waste of investor resources honestly.

Comment by Super-Base-: Mercedes is nowhere close to FSD, you’re buying into the level X bullshit. FSD may not be ready for unsupervised driving but it’s still years ahead of anything at any traditional OEM.
Comment by fakecricketplayer: At that point FSD should actually get deactivated. FSD should not be available unless all sensors/cameras are functional. It could limp to failure if one of them fail.
Comment by SpaceBoJangles: God I hate my state’s leaders
Comment by stickman07738: He needs NTSB approval first and that is not happening.
Comment by ProfessionalOkra136: It has to be the manufacturer or it's not unsupervised (Level 4+). Although I suspect there would be some nuance there if it was caused due to some neglect by the owner of the car.
Comment by largespacemarine: The owner, same deal as if you let someone else drive your car.
Comment by Chopper-42: You don't need to worry about that. They already have a working strategy in place. The car realizes it's about to crash and deactivates the autopilot. Now you're responsible and every press release will state that fsd was deactivated at time of the crash and you were in full control.

Pretty sure his grifting will ruin him eventually, just will take some time.  The downfall is going to be glorious
Comment by Old-Glove9438: In my country this is straight to jail. Right into jail.
Comment by Competitive_Body_611: So Musk is terrible, he is filled with BS. He give wildly optimistic timelines. He hasn’t done anything useful.  
Oh wait, he is launching reusable rockets at the highest rate and at the lowest cost of anyone. Some of these boosters have flown 20+ times. Yep terrible.  
He has embarrassed Boeing and NASA by giving the US a reliable spacecraft that didn’t exist after Obama cancelled the shuttle. He charged billions less for the work. I guess that is horrible too.  
He has put thousands of satellites in orbit that give high speed internet worldwide at a low price. He has donated thousands to Ukraine and recently to areas affected by the recent hurricanes. Terrible person.  
Now when it comes to FSD, which I have had for 2.5 years, hasn’t met his optimistic timelines. I guess it won’t happen based on your analysis. Go ahead and bet on that. I won’t.  
Sure Elon says crazy and even ridiculous predictions on timelines for his many endeavors. But does that mean they will never come to fruition? Don’t bet on it.  
The best quote describing Elon’s effort is, “We do the impossible —late.”
Comment by ric2b: Mass transit is dirty europoor stuff, American exceptionalism can't think of that as desirable.

Comment by Chinglaner: I actually laughed out loud when he called autonomously cars “individualised mass transit”. Like no, even an autonomous car still gets stuck in traffic. And he just glances of the fact that during rush hour, where are you gonna get your robot taxi, when everybody else needs it too?

Comment by largespacemarine: Why would a robot do that when his servants are cheaper?
Comment by Boring-Unit-1365: We’ve been able to do the friend thing since Asimo, but robots are amazingly bad at any cleaning/tidying job at the moment. They’re tricky (involve picking up random objects and folding fabric) and they have very bad failure outcomes (your favourite shirt gets ripped and plates go everywhere.) so they won’t advertise it until they’ve managed to solve it (which is a long way off imo)
Comment by No-Aide-8726: First thing they will want to do is have sex. One of the largest drivers of early adoption of many techs.
Comment by The-Phantom-Blot: >laundry, dishes, vacuuming,

The problem there is that we already have robots that do 90% of the work.  We're at the point of diminishing returns.  Few people would buy a $30k robot to do the last 10%.  Or, well, to do 5%, and leave 5% for you to clean up anyway.

>cleaning, etc. 

Now there's something that might have a use case.  A MarieKondoBot to force you to go through the clothes in the bottom drawer every month or so.

Comment by FroggyHarley: Coming from Elon, this sounds to me less like his vision for a utopian, AI-powered future, and more like his idea for how he can keep up his weird breeding fetish while not having to pay for more humans to raise his kids.

Comment by ProfessionalOkra136: >IMO it should illegal under Federal law for them to make vehicles without a steering wheel/etc. until it's been proven and certified by the government to be safe driving anywhere in the US without any human intervention.

It already is. He'll never be able to roll these out until he gets both NTSB approval and approval in the specific areas he wants to operate in. Same thing Waymo went through.
Comment by thelurkylurker: Anything "automatic" should always have a back up "manual" mode for unforeseen circumstances, period.

Comment by pdubbs87: Agree I’m a NYC guy. It would never survive a single road in Brooklyn
Comment by Chopper-42: I liked the enclosed front wheels. That was a design feature of the first Saab in the 40s. It makes the car very aerodynamic .. until it snows and the snow gets packed in the wheel well and you try to stear around rhe next corner and nothing happens.
Comment by newbizhigh: There's more to it than that. He announced, on Elon Time, a Robotaxi release for 2027. He is already 2 years behind his competitors who are already on the streets across the world. How much more competition will there be in another 3-7 years? Just like the Robot. He unveiled a Robot that Boston Dynamics has already well passed many years ago...not including the already mass competition in that market.

-Edit- And the van...he literally showcased the  futuristic version of the trolley. This mans future vision is the written past.
Comment by pdubbs87: Completely agree
Comment by GardenDesign23: Car brands go to zero all the time
Comment by brucebrowde: The way it's going, the rest of business is not going to be too viable for too long.
Comment by ProfessionalOkra136: He really needs to hand the reigns over to someone else at this point. The Model Y is still the best selling EV. The supercharger network is the gold standard for charging. But he's an actual threat to his own company at this point. After Model Y, it's just been turd after turd.

Imagine if Starbucks CEO was found to have given high-demand orders of coffee beans to Dunkin Donuts because he's also the CEO there, too. And tries to say it's a good thing for Starbucks to license coffee orders from Dunkin.
Comment by rethinkingat59: He also did it in an environment of cost cutting at Tesla as auto sales for all US manufacturers are down nationally vs 2023 by 12%. 

Delayed order deliveries is a common tactic in huge corporations to manage cash flow. (Delaying deliveries is not the same as canceling orders.)

Comment by cercanias: He reinvented a Pontiac fiero and a city bus that looks like a toaster.
Comment by brockhopper: Yep.  Who is a two seater for?  If the business model is replace or sell these to Uber/Lyft, then they're kneecapping themselves immediately.  Plus, the relatively empty space for 2 more seats doesn't add that much to the build costs or lifetime costs.  Maybe more frequent charges, but I can't imagine it's more than 15% more frequent just based on weight.
Comment by willkydd: You're not thinking strategically. If there are, let's say 10,000 passengers to be moved around per day in place... if you have 2 seats someone will buy twice as many robotaxis compared to the case in which each robotaxi had 4 seats.
Comment by RIP-RiF: Right? That's airport runs out, no room for family or luggage. That's most of your stabdard taxi fares left right on the table.
Comment by lkjasdfk: Huh? Have you ever seen a taxi? Very few have more than two passengers. 
Comment by NewCobbler6933: You *could* design for more but I think the majority of car trips are single occupancy, and many are also double occupancy. I think there is a business case for the two seater because it removes a lot of unnecessary weight which affects manufacturing cost, performance, distance per charge, and so on. 

Now it doesn’t matter because it will never come to fruition since it’s a Tesla product, but I don’t think being two seats is a major admonishment of the concept.
Comment by MNVikesFan69: Can almost guarantee a designer made something that looked great, and Musk would tell them to make it “more futuristic” over and over until we get these shitty designs.

Comment by virgo911: Those are exactly the things I would have assumed they were going to demonstrate they have begun to solve during this event. Instead we got rock paper scissors and dancing.

Make it pick up a dish in the sink, wipe the grime off, and put it in the dishwasher. Make it carry a hamper full of laundry down a flight of stairs and then load it into the machine and press a few buttons. Make it grab the vacuum out of the closet, unwind the cord, plug it in, and use it, then put it all away. Make it be able to check how full the vacuum container is and empty it if necessary. Make it be able to meet you at your car and carry the groceries in.

Obviously this is incredibly, incredibly difficult. Nearly insurmountable. But this is why you have a huge company pouring billions into it. Especially with the leaps and bounds being made with AI, it seems more possible than ever.

These are the things that will make this the future. Figure it out, mass produce it, improve the quality of life of EVERYONE. Millions of human hours per year are wasted on chores. Fill that space with productivity and creativity and who knows what comes of it.

Somehow, it doesn’t seem like they’re trying to convey this message or purpose with Optimus at all. We get dancing and rock paper scissors.

Comment by The_Hindu_Hammer: That's not the definition of vaporware, that's just the market underestimating a company's success. Vaporware is Elon demoing products and making promises about the timeline, cost, and scale that will never come to fruition. He's done this consistently over the years with FSD, robotaxis, Tesla roadster, etc.
Comment by mab6710: He said no Simpsons God damnit
Comment by Snakend: As an investor I understand that Elon Musk is the CEO of many companies and that he tries to synergize them as much as possible. I accept that as part of the deal in owning Tesla stock.
Comment by Fauster: If investors sued, it wouldn't be a typical trivially inexpensive $5 million lawsuit. But, breach of fiduciary duty is also a federal criminal offense and Musk already made a very involved consent decree with the government in order to avoid prosecution and stay CEO of Tesla from way back when he said Tesla was going private at 420. But, Elon is the leader of the U.S. Space program, with Boeing as a problematic backup, so that would be complicated.

Comment by Sanhen: Being generous to them, I think their idea is sell autonomous cars as a "luxury" option instead of the cheap option. The hope being that by making it feel luxury, people will actually want it over a car driven by a human being.

That might work in other fields (branding a wine as luxury could help margins even in the face of cheaper and perhaps even outright superior competition), but I question whether that would be beneficial in the taxi space. While there might be a niche of business clients that would gravitate to what's perceived as the luxury option, I think the vast majority of people using an app like Uber/Lyft just go for whatever's cheapest. Especially with the safety of autonomous cars still in question and the whole concept making some uncomfortable, I imagine the only way autonomous cars catch on in the mainstream is for them to be the more affordable, practical option compared to cars with a driver.

If autonomous cars are simply another option, but not a cheaper one, then I don't believe the majority of people would choose it at this time (perhaps that's an error on my part, though).

Comment by endangerednigel: The London Black cab design from the 60s fits 4-6, i don't think I've ever sat in a taxi that fits just two people, even new York taxis with a partition should fit at least 3 in the back, almost any cars with a bench back seat should fit 3

Comment by thelurkylurker: You'd be surprised at how many airports/airplanes still offload you on the tarmac and have you get on a bus to the airport/gate/plane. Usually they're "accordion" buses, with more than 20 seats.. but i can see the Tesla taxi-bus doing good in that sort of environment. Preset pickup and drop of locations. Short distances, infrastructure (power available) pretty much ready to install chargers. Just "chain" multiple busses according to people demand...

Comment by jedilord10: No, because they can’t go outside their little curated area., that’s the point. lol
Comment by jedilord10: The difference is Tesla built a solution for 80% of the roadways where as these guys built a solution relying on a very curated set of data that only exists in cities they map. Not scalable at all. And by the way, waymo does have take overs alll the time. Not sure about
BMW as that is never talked about
Comment by Green-Quantity-5618: Demolition man!

In Russia, the solution here is simple. Take SpaceX and make it a government acquisition. That's communism, right?

We don't want that here for sure, but at the same time, we do kinda need to just take SpaceX from Elon. We're reliant. I dunno if the government should own it, but Elon is a risk for us at this point.

We can't because of our government and the way we see things.

But doesn't it make more sense to be more flexible as a people? Shouldn't we take SpaceX from Elon at this point specifically because he's partisan and our military *isn't*?

I dunno. I'm torn on the whole thing, but it does seem to make sense that an amalgamation of governing systems is the best implementation rather than just declaring one and being strictly it.

That's what the robovan is for.
Comment by brockhopper: I can't find an easily sourced breakdown for Uber of what % of rides are Uber Black, so it's hard to say what the luxury market is there, but my feeling is it's pretty minimal.  People generally, especially for short drives, want the cheapest point a to b option.  And short drives are where these cars make the most sense.  So yeah, I agree with you that I don't see the use case for these vehicles as designed.  Plus, the thought of these operating in nighttime pickups, where drunk people are congregrating and acting like idiots in the streets and cars seems like a test of Tesla FSD it is not going to pass.
Comment by brockhopper: It would (although I'm curious where the 90% comes from?) be generally fine for point to point 1-2 person rides.  Although I've not seen anything about trunk space, so unless there's something I've missed you lose out on your airport and grocery rides.  As to the 3 or Y becoming used as robo taxis, I have doubts about that.  Maybe I'm being appropriately cynical, but there's so many years of BS on those models FSD that I don't have confidence in them.
Comment by brockhopper: Me personally?  I see it all the time, because I live in a college town.  Packed 3-4 to a car.
Comment by YoureNotEvenWrong: But how many are actually in the taxi with you?
Comment by lkjasdfk: Of course; but when 90+% times they’re used, it’s only one person, this taxi has too many seats. Yep is wasteful. Stop being bad for the environment. 
Comment by alloyednotemployed: Yea IIRC Musk had made design choices for one of the tesla models that conflicted with functionality. It definitely wouldnt be the first time his final say managed to screw with the process.

Comment by EyeAskQuestions: Russia is Capitalist. It hasn't been communist in like 30+ years.
Comment by rlovepalomar: One of the dumbest comments I’ve read in awhile. And Reddit has been getting dumber and dumber.
Comment by Cyeb0rg: You are absolutely spot on. Elon is too much of a risk at this point and it is not going to get better. In my opinion there should be some sort of laws similar to antitrust laws where instead of forcing companies that have monopolies to split up, companies where an individual has too much power can be forced to make that individual sell off shares to a certain level, let's say 10 percent just for example. That way the government doesn't have to take ownership of Spacex and Elon Musk would pose a less significant risk with only 10 percent ownership, and capitalism is not disrupted (although this should be of little consideration when national security is at risk). Or Spacex could just be taken over by the government and Elon given a check to go away. Either way is fine with me.

You really want me to believe that Russia has the same government and economic system as the United States? You truly believe that?
Comment by Wotg33k: I think the only dumb comment I can think of is when you disagree intellectually with a person but don't offer anything other than insults.

I'm unafraid of being wrong, but I'd love to know why I am. I'm typically even happy to be wrong.

But I really can't find a usefulness at all in a response like yours and it honestly seems the most ironic because you ask for more intelligence or understanding even while you remove it.
Comment by willkydd: If you don't many kids and don't plan to have moe (like Elon), then just get two smaller self-driving cars. You don't all have to ride in the same car.

Yes.

Everything else you said isn't what I stated.

Russia is not communist, it is not the USSR and it hasn't been for several decades now.

This can be found out with a casual google search or an American history text from the past 20+ years.
Comment by LIGHTNINGBOLT23: You desperately need to open any history book made in the last few decades. It's not 1984, it's 2024. You also need to understand that there's a difference between economic systems and political systems.
Comment by rlovepalomar: Where do I begin. 

Are you for or against capitalism? Not in the sense that capitalism sucks and should change due to the growing issues it’s cause with wealth and income disparity/inequality but just basic capitalism I.e.  right to pursue and own free enterprise? If so, dumb opinion. Who should “take spacex?” The government? The people? 

Let’s say the government takes it..what’re they going to do with it space x? They chose to stop funding and effectively render nasa useless during Obama administration and rightfully so they weren’t doing anything anyway.

What else, oh elon started the company solely because he believes in humans and making the human race multi planetary not for his own self interest but because he’s a dreamer at heart and wants the best for humanity generally speaking and whether or not you agree or disagree with his intention and if he’ll actually realize that dream in life or beyond it’s irrelevant to the fact that he is the sole reason there’s ever been a successful multi use of a rocket ship  by pushing his company and teams to achieve such a feat of landing  a rocket back on earth. Is the government going to do that? 

What else, mmm from what I can tell your sole premise for “taking away spacex from Elon” is because he has political partisan bias…what does that even fucking matter. First off pretty much everyone at the head of any company has political Parisian bias and that whether they show it or not. The difference I’ll give you is that space x isn’t just any company and the control Elon has over space x isn’t just the same control that every single head of any company has either. However, the fact that he’s has changed from generally liberal leaning to conservative leaning means he’s not beholden to anyone party and can be objective based on what he feels is in the best interest of the country. Aka he’s more than just someone who can be controlled by an establish beuaracracy which is in fact exactly what and whom should be at the helm of such a company like spacex. 

Theres plenty more to go into but I don’t feel like typing this all out on my phone and wasting my time deplaning o you how dumb you sound in making that comment. 

And if you don’t want to be called dumb, then think just a little teeny tiny bit objectively about what it is you’re going to say before put something out on the internet for everyone to see.
Comment by endangerednigel: So then the current taxi system is objectively better? providing for both single occupancy trips and higher occupancy trips without needing extra vehicles on the road?
Comment by Wotg33k: I disagree. It seems prudent that all I need do is post incorrectly online about something and a plethora of insulting plebians will show up to correct me. In that, I've learned.

So here we are, teaching me.

Are you all suggesting that the Russian invasion of Ukraine was something the people of Russia wanted? They were well represented there?
Comment by Wotg33k: I don't mind being called dumb. I said it seems dumb to throw insults and offer nothing of value.

Now you've offered something with some meat on it.

I made myself clear and you seem to have missed it. I didn't mention Tesla, did I? We're talking about SpaceX. And I said military for a reason because they are historically non-partisan.

So when the army came out and denounced what Trump did at Arlington recently, it was the first time or one of few times in American history that they did as much.

So when I then see Elon at the Trump rally dancing with Don himself, I can't help but be concerned about the government contracts that SpaceX and the military have in place.

So then the concern becomes.. what if Elon just decided to leave America entirely **specifically because of what you're saying**. We know he's flexible and doesn't have any loyalty to the party that lifted his green initiative to where it is. So where does his loyalty lie? Is it even American?

Which, if it isn't, cool. Great. Fine. Get the SpaceX military contracts out of our strategic design going forward.

Seems like every other major autoindustry and freight players already has some sort of autonomous fleet in the works and on the streets.

Could it be that Tesla's version of robotaxi will use something like tech from AUR, MBLY, LAZR?

No way I’m trusting HIS company to safely drive me anywhere, guarantee you he’s also harvesting all sorts of data from you when you ride in one too. Have fun being recorded in transit and used to train AI.
Comment by greenpride32: You do realize that Waymo is also using AI?

The camera only approach is going to spell doom for Tesla.  Camera can be obscured by poor lighting and objects and elements such as rain or blowing leaves.  Elon seems to be focusing on the AI aspect, but think of it this way - if my camera is sending obscurred images for AI to process - how can AI accurately make decisions?  Of course it cannot.

I had thought Tesla was going to debut something in addition to camera, but the invite to the event has a huge camera lens image on it - so it does indeed look like they're still going all in on camera.  Good luck getting regulatory approvals with that.

Comment by parkway_parkway: Tesla's main advantage over everyone else is the ability to scale and build the hardware/dedicated robotaxis at cheap prices.

Also the event tomorrow is called "We Robot" and imo it's possible that they will announce the humanoid robot will be released before the robotaxi.

Because to get the bot to work all you have to do is find **any** task it can do in a factory profitably.

Whereas to get the robotaxi to work you have to get it to handle **every** driving scenerio flawlessly, which is actually much harder.
Comment by VictorDanville: Tesla will be the first company to manufacture anti-matter powered cars
Comment by zkel75: Yes. Difference between Tesla is that there are so many out there.  We will instantly have millions of self-driving cars tomorrow after the software update for FSD 13 and executive order to enable self driving cars from a future president.  Waymo already has FSD but their fleet is much smaller.
Comment by Spankynpetey: I can’t back anything Musk at this point. I honestly think he’s lost his marbles, flew the cuckoo nest, spent too many night licking the windows.

I don't care if they present the most impressive performance tomorrow, I have no trust in Musk to do anything worthwhile anymore. I'd be happy with the technology, but I won't put my own money in if Musk is involved. If what they present is impressive, I may be convinced to invest in Waymo through Google.

And Tesla will moon on elon's fart sniffing and google will do nothing because their stock fuckin' sucks.
Comment by CouncilmanRickPrime: Seriously? I think the market has enough braindead morons who will buy the stock on this event. Even though nothing of substance will be said. 

I've seen it happen numerous times. These are the same people who got excited by Optimus.
Comment by CouncilmanRickPrime: >Tesla robotaxi had an incident at 150 miles…

Depends on your source. A third party tested FSD and came up with 13 miles before an intervention is needed. 150 is the crowd sourced data I believe.
Comment by greenpride32: There is no such thing as "Tesla Robotaxi" today so you are either misinformed or typing lies.  You need a license to operate an autonomous vehicle on public roads - TSLA does not have this.  And no FSD at L2 is not autonomous.
Comment by LFG530: Which is super weird might I add. If they don't deviate from that tommorow I think that this project will be doomed from the begining and every robotaxi manufactured with cameras only will only be a liability on the books. 

You wouldn't want to have your eyes only as a sense to navigate life, cameras are a good tool to perform a few tasks, but without a combination of technologies/sensors they are very very flawed and highly problematic in many climates/environnements.

Comment by StayPositive001: Remember when ChatGPT came out and then Google Bard did like a month later after the hat was out the bag. It's incredibly unlikely Google doesn't have a non geofenced tech stack. Waynon vehicles have been spotted outside of service areas all the time. The absolute worst case scenerio here is that it stays fenced. However over 80% of the USA lives in urban areas. If Wayno fenced the largest 100 cities, they'd capture 25% of the US population and the vast majority of day to day driving and taxi usage.
Comment by UnknownEssence: More like Waymo actually has robotaxis and Tesla doesn't.

If I promise to create a new version of the Internet, that's more advanced, but I never actually do it, is it really a step forward?

https://dawnproject.com/tesla-full-self-driving-way-ahead-of-miles-behind/
Comment by None: It has to do with the idea that Tesla wants to solve autonomous driving in a less constrained way to scale much easier. With vision they don’t have to rely on constantly re-mapping the same areas to update car behavior. Theoretically with vision the car should just “learn” how to navigate certain scenarios. Not saying it’s the best approach but if it worked 100% it is much easier to scale. Definitely not working 100% though.
Comment by CouncilmanRickPrime: And this experience will eventually lead to a car that drives with no driver? No proof or anything, we just have to believe.
Comment by lexbuck: Tell me more about how he’ll fix the government…
Comment by nzTman: Thanks, good perspective. Like I said, I’m not an expert on the topic, I was just giving OP some info. Happy to be corrected.

Comment by nzTman: Exactly. Like I said, I’m not an expert on the topic, I was just giving OP some info. Happy to be corrected.
Comment by CouncilmanRickPrime: Not really. You can't just rollout self driving cars with an OTA update. That's not how it works. You'd need approval everywhere.  That takes time.
Comment by CouncilmanRickPrime: I absolutely agree. It's why they can't take liability.
Comment by dabocx: It isn’t about mapping but about their refusal to use lidar in addition to vision.
Comment by peter-doubt: No.   please don't.  He'd be a blessing from business...  just like Herbert Hoover was
Comment by CouncilmanRickPrime: He'd end the war in Ukraine. 

"Why don't we just let Russia take land until it's exhausted?"
Comment by notdoingdrugs: I didn’t downvote you but I’m imagining your other comment may have been downvoted because “Tesla Taxi works on non mapped areas” - this is TSLA’s *goal*. They don’t have any L3 or L4 capacity (we’ll see what happens tomorrow) and have zero autonomous miles driven on public roads without a driver. *This* is where Waymo is far ahead.
Comment by None: What do you want them to use Lidar for? Waymo has to constantly re-map its environment to be able to navigate. Tesla doesn’t because it uses vision to assess what to do. That’s the reason Waymo is only in a very select amount of cities. 

“You wouldn’t want eyes as the only sense to navigate life.” I mean when you’re driving that’s pretty much the only sense you are using. Seeing that autonomous driving is trying to equal a human I think it’s pretty feasible.
Title : Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter
Tesla posted its third-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report on Wednesday. The stock fell about 2% in premarket trading after the report.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q3 2024: 462,890

Total production Q3 2024: 469,796

Analysts were expecting deliveries of 463,310 in the period ending Sept. 30, according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount.

Deliveries are not defined in Tesla’s financial disclosures, but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. It’s one of the most closely-watched metrics on Wall Street.

In the year-ago period, Tesla reported 435,059 deliveries and production of 430,488 EVs. Last quarter, the company reported 443,956 deliveries, and production of 410,831 vehicles.

Tesla is facing increased competitive pressure, especially in China, from companies like BYD and Geely, along with a new generation of automakers, including Li Auto and Nio.

In the U.S., EV competitors like Rivian are maturing, while legacy automakers Ford and General Motors are selling more electric vehicles after walking back more ambitious goals for electrification.

GM this week reported a roughly 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter from a year earlier. Still, its electric business is tiny compared to Tesla’s, with just 32,100 units sold in the latest period, accounting for 4.9% of the company’s total sales.

Ford plans to report results on Wednesday.

Tesla hasn’t issued specific guidance for 2024 deliveries, but executives have said they expect a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last despite the company having added a new vehicle, the angular stainless steel Cybertruck, to their lineup.

The company also said on Wednesday that it deployed 6.9 GWh of energy storage products in the quarter.

Shares of Tesla climbed 32% in the third quarter, erasing their loss for the year in the process. The stock is now up almost 4% in 2024, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 19%.

Tesla’s brand has been under pressure in the U.S. due in part to the antics of CEO Elon Musk, who, in addition to endorsing former President Donald Trump, has shared what the White House called “racist hate,” and false claims about immigrants and election fraud on X, his social media app.

But Tesla still sells more battery electric vehicles in the U.S. than any other automaker, with Hyundai a distant second.

In its third-quarter earnings report later this month, investors will be particularly focused on profit margins.

Tesla has continued to offer attractive financing options and an array of incentives to drive sales volume in recent months in China as well as in the U.S. Prior to earnings, Tesla will host a marketing event on Oct. 10, and is expected to show off the design of “dedicated robotaxi.”

Musk has promised Tesla self-driving cars for years, but the company has yet to deliver. Meanwhile competitors like Waymo and Pony.ai have begun operating commercial robotaxi services.

Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/02/tesla-tsla-q3-2024-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.htmlComment by PeteWenzel: Tesla would need to deliver 514,925 in Q4 for zero growth in 2024 over 2023. Unlikely that they’ll top 500k.
Comment by k_ristovski: Total deliveries Q3 2024: 462,890 (vs. analyst expectations of 463,310).

When you look a Tesla, they only have 5 models to choose from, and somehow they sell about the same or more than the big 3.  The last two models tesla introduced are the model Y, which is now the world best selling car, and the cybertruck, which is now the best selling automobile over 100k in the USA.  Whatever the next model is will move the needle significantly and the stock will reflect that.
Comment by Notorious1MSP: Tesla is an enigma of sorts. Every year it's something else and it always seems to trade on the future of whatever's next, never the facts of the present day. It's a car company. An energy company. An autonomous driving company. Robotaxi. An AI company. Oh and they will have a robot soon... I'll give Elon that he's an absolute genius - not at inventing things, at hype. 

All of that said, if they pull of autonomous driving, robotaxi and the Optimus robot in the next 18 months, the shares are not undervalued. It's just that he rarely delivers on these lofty promises.
Comment by Substantial-Hold6273: 462k MAGA hats is a lot tho
Comment by sdkiko: I used to want one and now I refuse to buy one because of Musk, great job
Comment by RoaringJohnson: See this is why you never short TESLA,!
Comment by None: It’s already bouncing back. Since selling 460,000 teslas in 3 months is actually quite incredible, and that’s the most cars they sold ever in a Q3 of any year. Q4 sales are exploding now that the FED FINALLY dropped rates. This is that elusive ‘bargain’ price you always hear about. Buying when others are fearful!
Comment by ARAR1: Luckily the next scam is scheduled for next week....something something robo taxi
Comment by VermicelliFit7653: They'll make up for it in battery, charger, and solar sales.

Right?
Comment by InjuryIndependent287: 400k of those deliveries are to themselves.
Comment by FirefighterFeeling96: at this point i wouldn't be surprised if the robotaxi runs on gas
Comment by skilliard7: Why is a capital intensive car company trading at 70x earnings if they aren't growing?
Comment by TimeTravelingChris: And margins will continue to be lower vs 2023 Qs.

Tesla is on track to make about $2 EPS yearly with flat to no growth. Fair price would be about $30.
Comment by discreettravelai: It's also a worrying trend of overproduction.   They are delivering less vehicles than they're making by a relatively wide margin, which suggests softening demand and will eat into their profitability.  With an ageing design for most of the range and a failed new product launch (cybertruck), it's heading in the wrong direction just as more competitors join the EV market.

But will it matter?  He will come out and announce something ridiculous that they will never deliver and the stock will surge.
Comment by looknowtalklater: And that’s assuming the books aren’t already being cooked by Enron Musk.
Comment by StayPositive001: Honestly sounds like fraud, like it's all made up, but at this point nobody cares, to the point that subtle jokes like this can be made
Comment by RampantPrototyping: Mostly supported on the vague promises of robotaxis, FSD, and robots
Comment by Jayswag96: Bro it’s a tech company bro I swear FSD is ahead of the competition bro it’s gonna be in every car in 5 years bro
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: Luckily for Tesla theres still no domestic competition 

Teslas only worry is China, which again luckily for Tesla is also a worry for everyone.
Comment by ZeroWashu: They are not just a car company and they missed the estimate by less than 500 vehicles. Energy Storage is up from last years 4.0 GWh which is a sign of good growth.  We will have to wait for the deck to know how well they are truly doing. 
  
I am not worried about Elon's political issues as he is backing a losing candidate, I would prefer he stay out of US politics but he is as free as any of us to put his cards on the table.
Comment by kenypowa: Meanwhile every other automaker sells 10% of Tesla's EV number and Reddit is hailing it a gigantic success.
Comment by NadenOfficial: Tesla currently set a new record in Norway. In Norway new cars sales in September where 96,4% electric. Tesla had 30% of the market share of ALL cars sold here, 3 times as many as the next one on the list. A new record. Norway is a nice picture of how it will look like elsewhere when infrastructure catches up. Its probably going to be bump going forward but im sure the sales are gound to rocket next year.
Comment by Swamivik: Wait until they pull out their profit numbers at the end of the month.

The only reason their delivery aren't worse is because of their 0% financing.
Comment by Sanhen: To be fair, this wasn't a big miss. Overall, Tesla's future looks suspect, but not meaningfully more suspect than it did before the release of its Q3 deliveries, so whatever fears the market has about Tesla were mostly already priced in.
Comment by deten: They also barely missed deliveries bby about 500 cars.  Less than 0.1%.
Comment by FreshMistletoe: We cancelled our Tesla (would have been our second after selling our 2021 for more than we bought it for during Covid) right before we were about to pick it up because he was posting offensive nonsense on Twitter.  He just doesn’t understand who his buyers are.  I love the environment, being kind to people, etc., being associated with him via my car is a no-go.
Comment by BlooregardQKazoo: Who would have thought that vehicles designed to be as cheap to produce as possible would have QC issues?

I don't know how Tesla gets such a pass on things like not having an instrument panel or steering wheel stalks, for no reason other than to save them money on manufacturing. Call me crazy, but I'll pay an extra $500 if it means I can see my speed without looking to the side. 

Or no one talks about Elon literally telling people building the cars to use fewer bolts to save money. 

When I'm driving a multi-ton machine that can kill me and others at any moment, I don't like knowing that the CEO pinches pennies on construction of it, but apparently that makes me weird.
Comment by tatang2015: Just wait! Mellon the felon will be bringing that stick down like xitter!
Comment by dexvx: Values from Y! Finance. When you're trading 10x PE from other automakers you are under much more increased scrutiny.

Stellantis - 2.75 FWD PE  
Ford - 5.43 FWD PE  
GM - 4.59 FWD PE  
Toyota - 7.59 FWD PE  
Tesla - 87.72 FWD PE
Comment by greenpride32: What made Tesla "special" before was they were the only viable EV player in the market.  Once other entrants appeared, I think Musk tried to rebrand the company into something else.  But the problem this time is there are already AI players, solar players, autonomous driver players and robotics players.  They are back to square one which is being in the pool of one of many.  

Can we even say Tesla is a leader in any of these areas?  For a period of time we could say that for EV's, but everyone has caught up.  And Telsa once touted low cost EV's for everyone - another promise they have not kept - and the Chinese have already done it.  The reality is Telsa has no moat or IP giving them a competitive advantage.  Their most powerful advantage has been government handouts in the way of high import tariffs on competition and carbon credits.
Comment by PeteWenzel: People tell me it’s because of their BESS business, which is ridiculous.

It’s because people trust the hype.
Comment by mackinoncougars: Elon Cult
Comment by Mojojojo3030: But the age old question—will it matter?
Comment by PeteWenzel: Indeed. This stock is priced as if there was an obvious growth expectation. There is one for EVs more broadly. But Tesla in particular? I just don’t see it. Half of their sales this quarter were in China. Other markets will have to grow rapidly for Tesla to simply offset the decline they’ll suffer there over the coming years.
Comment by Luph: dont worry theyre going to announce their highly profitable robotaxi any day now
Comment by greenpride32: Its seems they play accounting tricks with their carbon credits.  The amount they report in a quarter has varied greatly and seems to be higher during tougher quarters.
Comment by SomberMerchant: Cultish idiots continue to pile into TSLA though
Comment by Ordinary_investor: Indeed, there has not been a grown up in charge in our society for quite a few years now
Comment by hoopaholik91: I just wonder if they ever get bent over by having to refund FSD money.
Comment by toonguy84: Aren't we supposed to be getting a robotaxi announcement from Tesla in October (after years and years of delay)?
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: No domestic competition? Ford and gm are ramping up their ev deliveries and even Rivian gained a toehold. Tesla went from no competition to an increasingly flooded market
Comment by wp381640: > Luckily for Tesla theres still no domestic competition

Ironically because Biden introduced the 100% tariff on Chinese EV's saving their ass.
Comment by pzerr: Chevy truck is a full frame truck. It costs less than the CT and gets far more range. It actually may be able to do truck things. 

I do not plan on getting it anytime soon. Too many variables in new EV. But it has far better specs at a lower price. Pont being, their flagship truck that helped this quarter is an extremely niche and gimmicky product. Their FSD on all their vehicles is only averaging 360 miles between critical intervention.  You need that around 1 million miles before you exceed that of humans. Much of their hype is based on gimicky features and that gets old. Eventually it comes down to profits and margins. And that is being squeezed hard.
Comment by Visinvictus: GM is making some serious Tesla killers right now. They are competing on price and the build quality and interior of these cars is leaps above Tesla. As they now have access to the Tesla supercharger network I don't see much of a compelling reason to buy a Tesla unless you are a hardcore fan. Equinox and Blazer are direct competitors to Model Y, Lyriq compares favorably to the Model X and Silverado EV blows the Cybertruck out of the water in almost every metric.
Comment by BlooregardQKazoo: Hyundai/Kia makes better EVs, and is building factories to qualify for federal tax credits. A year that passes where they build up and release a 3-row SUV while Tesla does nothing except release a meme truck is a good year for Hyundai/Kia
Comment by largespacemarine: Why would you say something so demonstrably untrue?
Comment by Ehralur: China is not competing with Tesla, they're competing with legacy OEMs. Tesla is like Apple at Android prices, China is Android at Android prices (only interesting for people who don't want a Tesla for whatever reason), legacy OEMs are Nokia/Blackberry; they'll all be bankrupt or reduced to max 1M deliveries per year in 5-10 years' time.
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: In less concerned with Elons political issues (from a business sense, personally I don’t like it), but rather with his lack of focus. He is the ceo of 3+ companies, and spends a lot of time publicly commenting on Twitter. Tesla is a major company that needs focused and strong leadership. The more than a car company is a good line, but is it one that can be supported empirically? Automotive sales are still the vast majority of their revenue
Comment by NYSurf117: Both candidates are pretty much tied and any lead one has over the other is within margin of error. And Trump typically is underrepresented in polling.
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: 2 things. One, other carmakers sell multiple of Tesla in total vehicles, the fact they are catching up on EVs is a huge problem for Tesla. And also look at any automaker valuation next to Tesla, you’ll see Tesla is valued for exponential future growth, so any sign of that not materializing is very bad
Comment by None: Look at valuations buddy. Thats the problem with Tesla
Comment by lkjasdfk: To be fair, that’s their claimed number. Read survey after survey that say that 90% of people with a college degree will never buy a Tesla. Never. Ever.
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: The issue is if major competitors with much stronger footholds in the U.S., like GM and Ford, catch up to Tesla as infrastructure is building out. Norway is a fairly small car market
Comment by Hacking_the_Gibson: Nobody can support a $1T valuation on the “we’re big in Norway” pitch.
Comment by Chemical-Idea-1294: In 2024 their market share is 20.8%, VW group is at 21.6%. Yes, Tesla has a solid market share, but it was 22.8% in 2023.
Comment by Top-Currency: Norway has the same population as Minnesota. It's really quite irrelevant.
Comment by n05h: Norway numbers are sometimes quite skewed because Tesla ships in large quantities at a time, so sometimes they peak quite high and dip for a while depending on the shipment timing. So I am not sure it is that representative.

You really have to look at Norway per year, it spikes too much on a quarterly basis.
Comment by FirefighterFeeling96: yeah they juiced the deliveries numbers as hard as they could and they still came up short, sad
Comment by abcNYC: Sounds like a good 2 DTE yolo opportunity on some OTM puts.
Comment by indicisivedivide: More than that Tesla has a very bad build quality. Can't have a good reputation when Rich Rebuilds mocks your engineering.
Comment by a_simple_spectre: Not everyday you hear about selling a car with profit lol
Comment by Itchy_Palpitation610: I mean, most cars you have to look down to see your speed. Still requires you to look away from the road so what’s the concern there?
Comment by jdrvero: Check with all those GM shareholders who got wiped out in the last recession and lost everything while the “new” GM took all the assets.  Most car companies are just government job programs.
Comment by GranPino: It doesnt matter, when you have a legion of fan boys willing to buy Tesla shares, the same way they bought DOGE. Reality doesn't matter at the short or medium term. But at the long term.... it will eventually crash hard
Comment by Prior_Industry: Have you factored in dancing robots replacing humans for live events? 24/7 Moulin Rouge!
Comment by Inconceivable76: It hasn’t until this point. 
Comment by renome: Yeah, I doubt it matters much for the next quarter. But as much as I wouldn't bet against Tesla's ferocious fanboys by shorting its stock, I wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole either.
Comment by pzerr: Eventually.
Comment by None: Hang on, Elon said you gotta price the company as an automation company or else you have no idea what you are doing. And he NEVER lies...

Honestly I've found Tesla to be overpriced for a long time. They took their eye off the ball which was making EVs more mass market, and they are loosing market share because of it. The robotaxi thing is still a pipe dream from what I've seen of FSD at the moment. So yeah...
Comment by callmecrude: The expectation is that battery storage keeps growing. 100% growth in a sector that has 50% margins makes pretty much everything else they’re doing irrelevant
Comment by TimeTravelingChris: Oh, I 100% think Elon is trying to buy Trump precisely because of accounting fraud.


I suspect we will learn a lot about Tesla over the next 1 to 2 years as their huge sales years get far enough back and we learn how warranty maintenance, and depreciation impact their finances with a mature fleet. Especially since leases are tracked as sales.
Comment by StayPositive001: Nobody with HW3/4 will ever get a robotaxi. And no Musk won't refund you, at worst he pays a fine orders of magnitude less than his gain.
Comment by Inconceivable76: With the latest judge ruling that musk’s statements were puffery, I’m guessing not. 
Comment by RampantPrototyping: Yeah but I'm skeptical its gonna be much different than the previous 5 years
Comment by hoopaholik91: There has only been two months of delay for the robotaxi.

Tesla tried to say for years that regular Teslas would become robotaxis and that there would be no need to build a unique vehicle for it.

But it seems like Elon pulled this out of his ass earlier this year to stem the stock crashing after Reuters reported they stopped plans to make a new, cheaper sedan from the ground up.
Comment by brumor69: Supposed to be on the 10th, but honestly hard to believe they’re anywhere close to it. They don’t even have first mover advantage anymore considering that companies like Waymo are starting to roll out.

(and yes, FSD’s promess is to be more flexible than Waymo since it could potentially go anywhere while Waymo is limited to a map of a city. But I believe Waymo’s strategy is enough to cover 95% of the robotaxi needs tbh)
Comment by BlooregardQKazoo: We were supposed to get one in August after years of delay. And then THAT was delayed. You should expect the October announcement to be delayed too.
Comment by Inconceivable76: Aspirational announcement. 
Comment by EnigmaSpore: It’s next week on 10/11. Invites already sent out and everything. No way it’s cancelled now. It’s at hollywood studios though so expect robots to be guys on suits and be skeptical of everything
Comment by Surrma: Ford and GM hahahahahaha....hahahahahaha
Comment by bigwinw: There is competition but many customers won’t have confidence in Gen 1 EVs from Ford or GM.  I bought a Tesla Dec 2023 because they are the safe choice when it comes to quality. 

In 3-5 years once these companies have some runtime in their vehicles more people will have confidence in them.  But that will come quickly.

It doesn’t help Elon is a shit talker and has pissed off people on the left who are most likely to buy an EV.
Comment by SezitLykItiz: Ford and GM lmaoooo
Comment by trabajoderoger: Eh, still can't compare. Look at the roads. Like 9/10 EVs are still tesla cars.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: Saving legacy autos ass

If $15k China EVs came to the states and succeeded it would instantly murder all legacy autos EV divisions.

It would slowly eat away at Tesla until they weren’t profitable at all and cause huge struggle possibly bankruptcy 5+ years in.

Then once consumers fully moved away from ICE legacy auto would be completely gone.

It has nothing to with saving Tesla and everything to do with saving America
Comment by ChokePaul3: Ford and GM needed that far more than TSLA did
Comment by SPorterBridges: > Tesla killers

Oh god, he used the words.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: Subjective. Sales says other wise.

Let’s wait and see if GM has the balls to post their losses like Ford. Will it be a -100% margin as well?
Comment by mayorolivia: What people miss is other brands don’t have the Tesla cool factor. Same reason Apple won with the iPhone. The difference is Tesla is unable to use the cool factor to its financial advantage. The stock price is whacky.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: H/K is doing well, relative to everyone other than Tesla and China
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: Why would you say something dramatically vague with no proof to back up your claim?

The article is praising GM for not even selling 10% of what Tesla sold
Comment by Ehralur: He's been the CEO of at least 4 companies for almost 8 years now. I'd say Tesla and SpaceX have done quite a lot better than they would've with any other CEO despite his "lack of focus".
Comment by cdsfh: Get outta here with your common sense and understanding of the industry!
Comment by Ehralur: It's hardly a problem for Tesla that legacy OEMs are bankrupting themselves by selling EVs at a 30-50K loss per vehicle sold.
Comment by GLGarou: But like in the other thread, valuations no longer matter! /sarc
Comment by paucus62: Those surveys don't sound very serious... it's easy to say outrageous things when you have no stake in the decision. Once "Emily BLM ACAB TRAHR" graduates and is looking to buy a car, the real cost of ownership and operation numbers make a Tesla more attractive
Comment by Ehralur: If anything, people who can do basic maths are more likely to buy a Tesla since they're the cheapest cars to own in the world all costs considered. If anything, it's unintelligent people who only look at a sticker price and don't realise they could be saving thousands of dollars per year.
Comment by TimeDear517: Those are the same people that claim that Blackrock&Vanguard abuse financial power and buy politicians, and yet they have most of their portfolios in VUAAs and iShares.
Comment by kenypowa: 😂. 

All the Teslas you see driving on the road, must be faked.
Comment by NadenOfficial: Irrelevant ok, but all cars will be electric by 2040 anyway, you dont agree on that?
Comment by Mojojojo3030: Insightful, thank you
Comment by BubblyYak8315: This is absolutely no longer true and even when it was it was just fit and finish. Tesla is the most reliable EV you can buy when you care about just getting from point A to point B
Comment by Mt_Koltz: The downside is inflation. Yes the number of dollars you sold it for was higher, but sometimes you're breaking even at the end of the day because everything else (especially your next car) is more expensive.
Comment by BlooregardQKazoo: Most cars you can keep both your speed and the road in your field of view. You can't focus on both at once, but you can passively view the road while you focus down. 

Teslas make that much harder with the speed further down and well to the side.
Comment by dexvx: You do realize that a positive PE ratio means the company is making money, right?

GM TTM net income is $10.8B. TSLA TTM net income is $12.4B.

Interestingly, TSLA Q1/Q2 2024 carbon subsidy was $440M/$890M. So basically of the $12.4B in net income, about 1/3-1/2 is from direct government subsidies.
Comment by a_simple_spectre: Yeah but they won't stay solvent forever
Comment by Mojojojo3030: How long?
Comment by justswallowhard: So based on ur login only fanboys are hodl the stock, no institutions and big money?
Comment by a_simple_spectre: Remember when FSD arrived in 2016 ?
Comment by greenpride32: FSD is a driving aid at L2 of autonomy - it is not robo at all.  Waymo and Cruise both offer true robotaxis today at true autonomous L4.  

If the robotaxi event is to tout FSD L2 the game is over.  My expectation is there will be some new tech unveiled.  But it's literally years behind Alphabet as Waymo has already been operating for several years.
Comment by sketch24: It doesn't help that people are attacking robo taxis. Doesn't matter if you make fsd if people won't tolerate it because it replaces them
Comment by Echo-Possible: Battery storage will be a race to the bottom on profitability. There's no technological moat and the massive battery cell manufacturers are already winning the biggest contracts in the world (CATL, Samsung, BYD, LG, etc). And Tesla will be reliant on their competitors like CATL to grow their production so they'll just get undercut by the people who control the battery cell supply.

Static battery storage will be commoditized at maturity. There might be decent margins early on as capacity is lagging demand but companies will ramp up to meet that demand and Tesla has a very small minority of total storage sales so profit margins will erode and trend to single digits as everyone cuts prices to keep market share.
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: But it’s such an incredibly small portion of their revenue. Even if it maintained such high margins, which is optimistic, the battery business would need to grow by multiples to move the needle for the overall company
Comment by PeteWenzel: Why does it have 50% margins? What is Tesla bringing to the table here? They buy the cells, do some software, design, marketing and servicing and that’s it. Can’t anyone do that?
Comment by hoopaholik91: Huh, interesting. Although I think a big factor is that it was brought by shareholders. A lawsuit from consumers that say they aren't getting what they paid for may be more successful.
Comment by xjay2kayx: Pretty sure Elon has been promising FSD since ~2016 and Robotaxis since ~2019.
Comment by sarhoshamiral: FSD promises a lot but reality has been different. In my mind if they were so sure of FSD, they would have at least gotten L3 permissions in some states, in limited conditions just for bragging rights and testing liability issues.

Waymo has been doing actual driverless driving for a while now and I do agree with you their method works. We don't need robotaxis outside of major cities now. Also maps are needed in both cases, FSD can't also navigate without an accurate map but it is true that it doesn't need a high fidelity map like Waymo. ie without a map FSD will also not now it shouldn't take a turn when the road dead ends with U turn that's hard to make.

However that's a scale issue really. If Waymo wants to expand to an area, mapping it wouldn't be a big hassle.
Comment by chsiao999: They haven't even begun applying for actual FSD testing licenses on US roads without drivers yet. It's all smoke.
Comment by LewisTraveller: Not sure if you can laugh about it. The EV delivery from both companies are going up. 

Not to mention Hyundai/Kia, Volvo, Rivian, VW, and even Toyota with their PHEV. 

Tesla will continue to be the largest EV seller for this decade. However, they will just lose market share to the late starters.
Comment by Trademinatrix: Get a clue, man. They are catching up. IDK why you think Tesla's position can't be unrivaled. Look at the numbers and see if you can laugh at that.
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: Two car companies that sell many times more cars than Tesla, and are slowly catching up on ev market share… so funny
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: What’s funny about two massive legacy auto makers with rising EV market share?
Comment by pzerr: GM has a full frame truck that gets far more range then the CT, hauls more, and has a lower price. The CT had a initial demand that helped this one quarter but we are seeing a flood of CT for sale already on the used market. 

Who do you think will lead in the truck market? Tesla with a unibody and odd configuration along with low range or GM with conventional frame, decent range at a lower price?
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: Right, but only a couple years ago it was 99% Tesla. The major competitors are starting to close the gap, and Tesla appears to be slowing down
Comment by sarhoshamiral: There are two things going on:

* PHEVs are more suitable for most people in rural areas so they are still not getting an EV. A few people I know got a PHEV instead of an EV waiting for charging network to get better (Washington has decent gaps in popular spots like Lake Chelan even for Teslas)

* In Seattle, when it used to be 9/10 Tesla for EVs it is more like 7/10 now. I see a lot more other EVs around especially newer cars. Ioniq 5 was fairly popular last year, Rivian and Ariya's seem to be the popular choices these days if I look at cars with temp plates.

The point is, Tesla now will grow with the EV market. Their first mover advantage is gone and Musk is doing significant damage to the brand. So that 7/10 will be 5/10 next year, 3/10 the year after and then 1/10 in 5 years if this trend continues.
Comment by TimeTravelingChris: In California, yes. Not true anywhere else in the US. Where I live Hyundai EVs are becoming very common.
Comment by RampantPrototyping: I would argue that creating a distinction between EVs and ICE creates a false dichotomy. Its rare that customers are 100% on either team EV or team ICE. EVs are competing against ICE cars and hybrids so its all the same market
Comment by None: I see a lot of Rivians now, no way Teslas are 90% any more. I don’t see 9 teslas for every other EV. I’d say it’s probably 50/50 now
Comment by Savings-Seat6211: Sure, but most of those chinese EVs look good aesthetically and provide serious value for the consumer. give them a few years in the US market and they'd take tesla's lunch too.
Comment by StagedC0mbustion: There is no cool factor with the way Elon has behave
Comment by Visinvictus: I test drove a Tesla, the interior was probably the least cool thing I have seen in any car ever. It looks and feels cheap and lame, like they have spent the last 5 years cost cutting. Elon has spent the last few years doing everything possible to alienate his main customer base as well.

I bought a Blazer EV earlier this year and it feels so much cooler than a Tesla. The one area that it's behind Tesla is on the software/operating system, I will admit GM is still playing a bit of catch-up there. Even that has been getting incrementally better through updates since I bought it. That being said, for the things that matter it works perfectly fine.
Comment by BlooregardQKazoo: Teslas advantages over H/K are solely software and charging network. H/K makes better EVs *right now*.
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: And I disagree. I think spacex has done quite well, but Tesla has lagged. Obviously the boring company didn’t do so well, and of course X is doing very poorly
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: Honestly the thing I notice most from a lot of comments I’m seeing is a lack of understanding about the future looking nature of the market. So many people have told me how ford/gm have only a fraction of the ev market share and don’t seem to realize that the current percentage is much less important than the direction. Competitors share is growing. Tesla share is flat or shrinking in many markets. That’s the story
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: You think gm and ford are bankrupting themselves? They are not
Comment by BlooregardQKazoo: Tesla is more attractive than ICE cars, but not more attractive than competing EVs.

Emily can buy an Ioniq 6 and get a better vehicle, period. And it'll be capable of charging at Superchargers soon.
Comment by BlooregardQKazoo: My Kia Niro cost less to buy than a Tesla, is cheaper to repair because the parts are easy to come by and it was designed for repairability, and because of that is cheaper to insure.

Tesla's problem is that they aren't the only EV in town now and they no longer get to claim EV advantages as Tesla advantages.
Comment by Angrybagel: Depreciation eats up a lot of the savings though. I'm actually not sure, it could wipe them out depending on how we compare. And if you want to look at lifetime costs I think a Honda or Toyota are likely to last way longer unless you're considering battery changes.
Comment by Itchy_Palpitation610: That’s fair but from my 5 years experience driving both a Y and a S you can quickly glance to see speed while keeping traffic in your periphery for the split second you glance it similar to any other standard vehicle. 

And I say this after turning in my rental car with a standard cluster that still required me to glance away at similar intervals and length of time.
Comment by Sanhen: It depends. Tesla might be overvalued relative to its financials, but it's also still turning a profit, so insolvency doesn't seem to be a serious risk at this time. Of course, that could change in the future.
Comment by Blackhawk149: Not when hybrid is going mainstream via Camry
Comment by GranPino: There are managers of institutional money that are cloud chasers and very naive people believing Tesla is going to build a trillion dollar business in IA, in robot taxis and in humanoid robots. So also Tesla fan boys
Comment by M0dsw0rkf0rfr33: I forgot about FSD arriving in 2016, I was too busy enjoying the Robotaxi and living off all that passive income it was able to generate!

My robot butler, that’s totally not controlled by a human off stage, and I are too busy stylin’, profilin’, limousine riding, jet flying, kiss-stealing, wheelin’ and dealin’ to care about FSD.
Comment by None: While I think FSD is quite flawed, saying it's years behind the competition is equally inaccurately. Tesla, for better or worse, is trying to design a system to handle every possible scenario right away, rather than trying to achieve the incremental levels along the way.

This makes evaluating it against waymo and others difficult. On the one hand, you can get more predictable behavior from waymo given that they can clearly state what it can and can't do. But a feature comparison is really difficult.
Comment by callmecrude: Profit is what matters here. 75% of Amazon’s profit comes from AWS despite it being 15% of their revenue. 

In Q1, Tesla made $1.13B profit and $0.5B of that came from energy and services, despite those divisions making up a tiny fraction of the revenue.
Comment by TimeTravelingChris: It's also easy to copy.
Comment by a_simple_spectre: Also gonna need a near-ish super conductor breakthrough

Either that or SUVs are about to get a new class
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: It's unwise to dismiss the value created in hardware and software integration.  Tesla's solutions are close to turnkey and are relatively simple to drop onto a site and connect.

In 2007-2008 there wasn't much special about iPhone either: commodity LCDs & battery packs, ARM cores that anyone could buy, some design, and a lot of marketing, but the sum ended up much greater than the parts and Apple's revenue growth reflected that.
Comment by callmecrude: People said the same thing about EVs. Ford, GM, and VW all claimed they’d surpass Tesla by 2025 in production. It’s now looking like all of them combined won’t be anywhere close. Manufacturing and logistics are a tough area to break into, where the first movers typically see massive success.

There’s a desperate need for energy storage and Tesla is the only game in town capable of scaling
Comment by hoopaholik91: Not as a separate vehicle. He wanted to turn customers' Teslas into robotaxis.
Comment by Surrma: Been an interesting couple days for TSLA...
Comment by the_doodman: More ICE cars. How are their EV ramps and margins going?
Comment by Ehralur: The fact that they're losing more money per EV sold than a Tesla costs in the first place. It would literally be more profitable (less unprofitable) for Ford to buy Teslas and sell them at a small loss than it is to sell their own EVs.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: GM put up a new record for EV sales this quarter and it’s still not even 10% of what Tesla did

If Tesla and China didn’t exist this would matter.
Comment by SezitLykItiz: "initial demand"

Oh wow, a talking point from 2017. Haven't seen that in a long time.


So if GM, an "American" company that makes oversized crome plated plastic disposible cars in Mexico and then sells it to misguided Americans who think they are being patriotic by buying "American made", actually made good cars, they would be able to sell a car or two in other markets where their Murica shtick doesn't work. Like Japan, or Europe, or rest of Asia. But nope, they can't. 

Not only do they not make good cars, they make dangerous cars. 200 Americans died due to the ignition issue which GM knew about for a decade but they didn't fix it. This isn't some 70s story, this happened in 2016 with the "new" GM. And then they fought the victims in court trying to weasel out of a settlement. Fuck GM.
Comment by cdsfh: Hertz has been offering more Kia EV6s and IONIQs lately as they’ve sold off their Teslas.

E: at least to me as a frequent car renter through Hertz
Comment by trabajoderoger: CA is a huge market. What state are you in?
Comment by hoopaholik91: Your intuition is actually right. Tesla has 49.7% market share as of Q2.
Comment by Kenneth_Pickett: Rivian has sold 70k cars in its history. Thats 15% of what Tesla sold this quarter.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: Subjective
Comment by Ehralur: Tesla went through production hell and managed to scale from ~100K sales a year to 2M over that period. They grew revenues faster after reaching $10B than any company in history. How is that lagging?

Also X is obviously doing great, seeing as Twitter was on course to be bankrupt by now and X is still going and rumoured to be close to running break-even.
Comment by cdsfh: >!I was joking, of course, I wish more posters were rational and understood how it all works!<

Agreed, and you can argue your fact based rationale in here, but most posters in here don’t care to understand.
Comment by the_doodman: Do you forget that companies need to actually make money to continue operations? None of that is relevant if ford and gm don't have viable paths to profitability selling EVs. And at this point, they don't.
Comment by the_doodman: ... Because they're clinging to ICE sales. Their EV business are hugely unprofitable and ramping slowly. No clear path to success there.
Comment by Ehralur: Yes, they are. They are clinging to ICE/Hybrid sales which will be largely gone in 5 years, yet they have no realistic path to making money on EVs.
Comment by Ehralur: Fair enough, the KIA Niro is pretty similar if not a bit cheaper in cost of ownership, but it's a rare exception.

Besides, the Niro is significantly less safe than the Model Y, has only 65% of the Y's cargo capacity, is much slower, has worse software, worse warranty, and I could keep going for a while, so it's not exactly a comparable car.

That said, it's definitely still a decent EV and a cheap one at that. The insurance isn't that much cheaper (at least where I live) though. Either way, I would easily pay the 6K extra to get a Tesla, but if you're only looking at price you make a good point. It's still the 0.1% of cars that as cheap or cheaper than Teslas though.
Comment by Ehralur: Not even close. Teslas had high depreciation between late 2021 and late 2023 because of the price drops, but the norm is that they have significantly lower price depreciation than ICE. Which makes sense, seeing as an EV can easily do 500K miles without any amount of serious maintenance, while an ICE car struggles to do over 250K miles and needs lots of maintenance to get there.
Comment by greenpride32: Stocks that trade at TSLA valution typically don't have flat growth, no moat, and declining margins.  It's simply not enough to just have a profit.  When you compare them to other megacaps, they stick out like a sore thumb.  Everyone else is fully established and one is just a bunch of what if's.
Comment by greenpride32: FSD is certified for level 2 of autonomy which means a driver with hands on the wheels is required at all times.  I do not consider this "robo".

Waymo is certified for level 4 of autonomy which means there is no driver in the car at all.  You can probably find YT videos for people who hailed rides.  This is considered "robo".

Tesla is clearly aiming for L4 or L5 for their robotaxi amibitions.  Waymo has been offering robotaxi rides for 7 years - how is Tesla then not years behind?

Telsa is relying soley on cameras, I assume because they don't want big ugly LIDAR sensors to ruin their image/look.  Problem with cameras is their vision can easily be obscured.  Do you have a backup camera on your car?  Ever had a drop of water from rain or puddles get on it?  Usually cleans off by itself very quickly but just that split second and it can cause an accident.  Water drop is just one example, what about direct sunlight, glare and shade?  

Waymo uses both LIDAR and camera, because they already know camera has limitations.  You have to remember here, Tesla can't just put any product on the shelf (or road) and sell it.  The product must meet safety regulations and receive a permit to operate as autonomous.
Comment by bartturner: FSD is where Google/Waymo was at 6 years ago.   Well kind of.

Because even 6 years ago Waymo was doing rider only and NOT requiring someone to sit in the driver seat.

So really more than 6 years.
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: Profit isn’t the whole picture. AWS could only succeed because of the massive retail side that carried the weight of the business. When their retail numbers struggle, the stock price struggles no matter how well AWS does, because AWS can’t carry the business yet. Same with Tesla. Tesla is valued at 3/4 of a trillion dollars currently. Obviously a half billion of profit cannot sustain that valuation. They are priced for tremendous growth, and any hurdle in that growth story is a real issue
Comment by Echo-Possible: Tesla has a very small percentage market share of BESS. CATL, BYD, Samsung, LG, SK have also developed turnkey solutions. They are beating Tesla out for some of the biggest new projects in the world. This will be a race to the bottom on profitability and commoditized product.
Comment by PeteWenzel: BESS isn’t a branded item. No one cares which company put together their solar modules. No one cares who made their BESS. Least of all utility companies who buy it for grid storage. They’re incredibly price sensitive.
Comment by PeteWenzel: BESS integration won’t be a high-margin business for long. It’s like solar modules. For consumers it’s a simple no-brand commodity item, where price matters above all else. And for large-scale grid storage where the customers are utilities or municipalities even more so.

Trying to justify 12 figure valuations based on that is ludicrous.
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: I don’t understand your comment. Both gm and ford are delivering more EVs. Not more than Tesla, more than they did last year. They are increasing their market share. This is very straightforward. Their ev margins are terrible. That’s not the danger to Tesla currently tho, margins improve with economies of scale and additional investment. F and gm trending up on ev delivery is an issue for Tesla
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: Tesla also started with negative margins, that’s how the build phase of the business goes. That’s what teslas advantage has been. But since EVs represent such a small part of the revenue of ford or gm, they can stomach the negative margins while they build up the ev business. Tesla is fully tied to their ev sales and margins currently. This is about competing with Tesla in their own space
Comment by None: [deleted]
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: The fact that a legacy automaker with a p/e of 5 is taking almost 10% market share from Tesla in EVs is a huge deal. Tesla, for comparison, has a p/e of almost 70 and sells far, far fewer total cars. Losing an market share of EV sales is a significant problem for them
Comment by pzerr: No one is saying Tesla is in trouble. But you stated it exactly. GM is putting up new records in sales. Tesla is declining. This would not matter except that 90% of Tesla's share value is based on Tesla maintaining massive growth.
Comment by StagedC0mbustion: Then buy calls 🤡
Comment by pzerr: LOL. The CT is not even allowed for sale in Europe because it is dangerous to pedestrians. It has sharp edges and lack of collapsible panels that is now expected to pass EU standards. GM trucks pass those safety standards and actually are allowed for sale there. 

So please to do not talk about safety when it comes to the CT in any way. Tesla does not even allow 3rd party crash testing and only does it 'own' testing. Ford, GM, Toyota.... all are third party tested and certified.
Comment by TimeTravelingChris: Not CA.
Comment by None: Yeah; that makes sense. I probably see more Rivians since I’m buying one, but I see tons of non Tesla EVs for sure
Comment by None: So? Im just saying I’m seeing more and more of them
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: They are lagging because they are ceding market share. They went from being the only game in town to having multiple rivals. 


X has allegedly lost 80% of its value since musk bought it. Advertisers have fled the platform. It’s delusional to say he’s been running it well
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: Dude I’m not sure what world you’re living in, but both ford and gm are profitable businesses. They are using that profit to launch their ev business which is new and obviously not profitable yet
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: Their ev businesses are a minuscule fraction of the larger businesses, which can easily prop them up as they scale and ramp. You make it sound as though these massive legacy automakers are dependent on their nascent ev businesses which is so far from the case
Comment by SoSeaOhPath: Yeah, the institutions are going to have to get realistic soon. With no growth there’s no reason for them to hold that stock. No amount of TSLA fanboys can hold up this $800 billion bag of hot shit
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: [https://www.ess-news.com/2024/08/26/global-energy-storage-cell-shipment-h1-2024-retrospect-and-prospect/](https://www.ess-news.com/2024/08/26/global-energy-storage-cell-shipment-h1-2024-retrospect-and-prospect/)

>The **global energy storage system shipment volume stood at 90 GWh in the first half of this year.**

>The **top five BESS integrators on the AC side** are **Tesla**, Sungrow, CRRC ZHUZHOU INSTITUTE, Fluence, and Envision, having shipped more than 30 GWh together.

>The **top five BESS integrators on the DC side** are **CATL**, BYD, HyperStrong, RelyEZ Energy, and Narada Power, which together shipped more than 20 GWh.

>In both categories, the top two manufacturers account for the lion’s share of shipments, leaving the rest far behind.

We know from Tesla's 10-Q filing for Q2 '24:

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828024032662/tsla-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828024032662/tsla-20240630.htm)

>In 2024, **we deployed 13.46 GWh of energy storage products through the second quarter.**

Tesla had just under 15% global market share total, and nearly half of the top 5 for AC systems.

So while it is accurate to say that their market share is small currently, Tesla is relatively larger than most of its competitors.

Note:

* Tesla's Megapack factory in Lathrop, California is not fully ramped (40 GWh/year expected full capacity)
* Tesla has a 2nd Megapack factory under construction in Shanghai, China.  Expected production capacity is at least 40 GWh/year.

>This will be a race to the bottom on profitability and commoditized product.

Time will tell.
Comment by bobskizzle: Unless you're in power systems engineering or a similar field, you're simply talking out of your ass.

Integration is *the* value-add for this kind of market. Nobody on the ownership side wants to put together an entire department of engineers to bring the system design, vendor selection, manufacturing supervision, field installation support, and maintenance in-house. Offering these solutions turnkey is how the entire facilities industry works. HUGE companies like Bechtel, Jacobs, CB&I, all do this same kind of thing in their specific area. Having the manufacturing part in-house is a HUGE moat.
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: Again, Tesla's energy solutions are close to turnkey and easy to deploy.  Branding isn't part of my argument for why Tesla's energy sales continue to grow rapidly.  

The SEC 10-Qs from 2023 reported that Tesla deployed 4 GWh of storage in Q3 '23, and today's press release reports that grew to 6.9 GWh in Q3 of this year.  That's 72.5% YoY growth.  Tesla is clearly creating value here for their customers.
Comment by callmecrude: It’s impossible to say what the long-term 20+ year outlook will be. But to compete in the space and build out a factory like Tesla’s megapack facility is a 5+ year commitment that no one else is currently biting at. Until there’s competition Tesla can charge whatever they want as they’re currently sitting on a 2+ year order backlog. 

I don’t own Tesla, I’m just pointing out the reality of why it’s priced the way it is. 99.99% of people in these threads don’t seem to understand the landscape of the power industry. They just know they don’t like Elon and look for reasons why the stock should be $10 instead of objectively valuing all pieces of the business. Tesla is currently on track for their energy and service division to be making more profit than the rest of the company combined by 2025, while growing at high double digits or low triple digits.
Comment by Ehralur: What are you talking about? Tesla only ever had 1 quarter of negative gross profit margins, Ford Model E is around -100%...

EDIT: Why is this getting downvoted? It's a simple statement of fact that anyone can Google:
https://x.com/alojoh/status/1826694840567931308

EDIT EDIT: Apologies, [Ford is actually at -200%, not -100%.](https://www.shacknews.com/article/140697/ford-f-model-e-ev-q2-2024-margins)
Comment by Ehralur: It's hilarious that you're trying to lecture me while not understanding that capex has nothing to do with gross margins but with operating margin.

[Tesla was never gross margin negative, except for a one-off outlier quarter.](https://x.com/alojoh/status/1826694840567931308) [Ford is hovering at -200%.](https://www.shacknews.com/article/140697/ford-f-model-e-ev-q2-2024-margins)

> To put it plainly: Ford & GM are not spending the amount of a Tesla on every vehicle on a unit basis.

To put it plainly: Yes they are. That's exactly what gross margins mean.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: Does GM also have the best worldwide charging network, or a large % of the global battery storage market, or the second most capable public self driving system, or profit margins on EVs, or….

Tesla is overpriced, but GM is too.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: Teslas GROWTH is declining. They are still growing overall 

Unlike GM, who peaked in 2017. They’ve just managed to trick idiots into paying more for the same junk.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: I’ve been DCA out of Tesla since like $260. Sure as shit wouldn’t buy GM tho
Comment by SezitLykItiz: Forget the CT. Talk about M3 and MY. Actually, forget Tesla, I dont want to even defend it. You're the one saying people-killing GM is so awesome. I never said anything about how good or bad CT is.

Talking about "GM safety standards" lmfao fuck GM.
Comment by trabajoderoger: Then no one can really confirm you're statement
Comment by Kenneth_Pickett: I dont even like Tesla but it was just a stupid comment. Theres 1% as many Rivians on the road as there are Teslas. The reason seeing a Rivian is so significant to you is because theyre so rare.

Also acting like having “only 50%” market share of a huge growing product is funny. Apple has been losing market share since 2012. What a suffering stock its been since /s
Comment by Ehralur: Every CEO or VC and their mothers have been praising Elon for getting rid of 80% of staff and still operating it more effectively and much more profitably (or less unprofitably) than before. They made more improvements to the product in the first year than Twitter did in the decade before. With 20% of the staff...

You're delusional.
Comment by AustinLurkerDude: I believe the concern is they (ICE companies) will run out of money or never reach profitability with their EVs. EVs like ICE can only be profitable at scale, you can't profit only making 10k cars/yr. Hence why Lucid, Rivian, etc. releasing much cheaper models, as they all use common SW/HW platforms or components. 

  
Billions in losses isn't surprising, Lucid and Rivian doing the same. Just question on burn rate, since the EVs are being supported concurrently with ICE cars.

  
BMW and Cadillac are aggressively pricing EVs at substantial reductions of MSRP to get them moving. Often with tax credits or really low interest rates just like Tesla. By the time the ICE companies actually get a profitable economy of scale they'll be fighting several EV only companies along with Asian (BYD/KIA, Hyundia) ones. 

  
The good news for ICE companies is there's still several decades of ICE car sales remaining so they do have time.
Comment by VermicelliFit7653: >Branding isn't part of my argument

Then why did you make the iPhone comparison?

Power storage is a commodity, period. Long-term it will come down to the cost of the batteries, and Tesla doesn't even have any real advantage in battery technologies.

>Tesla is clearly creating value here for their customers.

But not nearly enough to justify the valuation.
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: Their first full profitable year was in 2021…
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: How do you figure GM is overpriced??


What you point out is actually an issue I see for Tesla, they don’t have clear direction. Are they a battery storage company? What is their revenue, market share and growth plan for that business? Profit margins on EVs are not something to rest on, others will catch up just as they are catching up on deliveries, and they have far more diversified revenue from traditional vehicle sales to balance out losses as they catch up. Self driving… is a far ways away from being a money maker. Tesla has a lot of strengths. It also has a lot of challenges. The biggest one I see is exactly what I said in my first comment: lack of strong leadership to navigate the challenges and opportunities
Comment by largespacemarine: Everyone has the same charging network. And Tesla batteries are world renowned for using terrible chemistry, they are not insurable for utility scale sites for example.

They don't have a functioning self driving system, their margins are decreasing. You are simply a fanboy.
Comment by GranPino: Tesla has a 50% in some battery factories that actually Panasonic manages it. They can buy batteries to the competence., as the battery business is becoming increasingly saturated, with falling prices. It was a comeptitive advante earlier, right now, not so much.

The technology of Tesla for selfdriving isnt the best in the market. the difference is that they are the only one willing to let drivers to use unsafe technology. 

Right now, Tesla has lower margins than BYD, whose valuation is so much lower, although BYD has better margins, build more EV cars, has more additional business, and they are actually growing
Comment by pzerr: Actually no. They sold few cars than last year and their margins got way smaller. They are making about half the profit they did from last year. That is a significant decline in every metric. 

GM stock price is reasonable based on their profits and growth. Tesla stock price is based on 50% growth year after year. It took about a 50% decline this year in profit and 10% decline in manufacturing.

And their key product they say their value is based on, Self Driving? On average requires critical intervention every 360 miles. To be mainstream, it needs to extend that to about 1 million miles between critical intervention.
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: Likewise lol
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: iPhones are excellent products independent of their branding.  They're generally reliable, have many years of software support, the user interface is consistent, and integrate well with cloud platforms, whether Apple's iCloud or something else.

People buy iPhones because they work well, not just because they're sold by Apple.

>But not nearly enough to justify the valuation.

While I agree with you, we are not the ones who set the valuation.  The markets set the valuation.  Whether the valuation is justified is a pointless question.

The only relevant question is whether you believe Tesla is or isn't likely to be worth more within your investment time horizon, and its potential relative to other investments under consideration.
Comment by Ehralur: Are you seriously frequenting a stocks subredddit without knowing the difference between gross profit margins and operating income...?
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: GM is shrinking but priced for growth. Historically it should be a lower pe.

Tesla is overpriced but at least it’s growing and successfully adding revenue streams.

GM is cannibalizing its ICE sales for EV sales which they are not profitable on. Only 50% of GMs ev customers were new, which means 50% didn’t buy a profitable ICE car but instead bought an unprofitable EV.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: Everyone has access, they pay for it while Tesla gets paid for it.

Everything outside of margins decreasing is subjective.

You don’t understand businesses.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: 430k

Title : The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. 
Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. 

The ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.

According to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.

Below is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..

|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|1933.5|10.91||
|1940|12.05|10.44%|
|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|
|1953|26.38|43.13%|
|1959.5|58.68|122%|
|1966|92.88|58%|
|1972.5|107.14|15%|
|1979|99.93|-7.22%|
|1985.5|191.85|91.90%|
|1992|408.78|113%|
|1998.5|1133.84|177%|
|2005|1181.27|4.10%|
|2011.5|1320.64|11.70%|
|2018|2471.65|87.10%|
|2024.5|5525.29|123%|

While the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.

Historically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.

Currently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.

In the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...

* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).
* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).
* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).

Images aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07

Historically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.

* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.
* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.
* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).

**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**

Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.

* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.
* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.
* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.
* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.
* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.
* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.
* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.
* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).
* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.
* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.
* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.
* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.
* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.
* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.
* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.

I believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.

**This economic downturn may be severe.**

In the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.

**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**

People have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.

This will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.

**What happens from here?**

I don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.

Comment by Yolo-Nolo: Great post. I think you have hit on a number of interesting points. PE/banks unrealized loss/etc. 
However, these points don’t necessarily correlate to a bubble burst or market correction. 2008 was mostly due to compiled sub-investment grade mortgages. I do think some companies are overvalued but their revenue continues to grow. So there might be some correction in NVDA or GOOG let’s say, but that won’t cause the market to completely crash. Traders took gains today, but it doesn’t mean they won’t reinvest tomorrow. I’m all for doom and gloom, and while you have compelling points, they don’t necessarily connect with each other. Let’s see how it all plays out!
Comment by Bos35: I think something you may be overlooking is the valuation of some of the s&p500 companies. Many AI high fliers in there could be seen as skewing the valuation. Take a look at the equal weight s&p index, trading at around 16.5x 2025 and 15.15x 2026 earnings. Just something to consider 🤷
Comment by Dan23DJR: Something to keep in mind, is that SPY is the global hoover of savings and retirement funds, much more so now than it was 10 or 20 years ago. 

2 of your 3 crash examples from PE ratio going over 30 were from an era where the average person didn’t really have any involvement in the stock market. Nowadays, SPY and other various S&P500 trackers literally hoover up people’s personal savings, from across the globe. Even on countries like mine (England) where pensions are more powerful than the US, around 23% of the population invests in the stock market, most people set it and forget it on an automatic monthly investing schedule. The top two ETFs people go for here is VWRP and VUAG, the first one being an all world tracker with 2/3 of its weight in the S&P 500, and the second one just being a straight up S&P 500 tracker.

And this is in the U.K - we don’t invest in the FTSE 100, Japanese people aren’t investing in the Nikkei, mainland Europeans aren’t investing in the STOXX 50, etc. Everyone across the globe invests one way or another in the US stock market, specifically S&P 500. Most people aren’t active trader types, they just have a monthly direct debit so it automatically buys into the S&P 500 for them every month.

Even 10 years ago this wasn’t really much of a thing. But with investing/broker apps being so mainstream and easy to access on phones, there’s massive amounts of people investing in the US stock market. Much more so than there was in the era of the GFC or the dot com bubble. 

Like I said, nowadays it is literally the global hoover of everyone’s personal savings. This has got to contribute atleast in some way to inflated P/Es because much more people want to buy into it now than ever before.

Comment by Water_Ways: Not really accounting for the fact that pensions are largely a thing of the past.  So younger/middle age workers are basically forced to put their retirement into the stock market.  Would that maybe imply higher PE levels on average than history would indicate?
Comment by shrewsbury1991: Forward PE of Sp500 is 22.4. Now you can argue that if companies start missing earnings badly than your thesis may be correct. However, a common mistake I used to make was applying historical trends in the past and applying them to the present. Sahm rule for example, etc. The fact is that the makeup of stocks in the Sp500 is radically different than a generation ago means that historical trends of the sp500 is pretty much as worhless as ticker tape, a sign of the times so to speak.
Comment by Naamch3: Very nice post! Lots of time and thought went into it. I appreciate it. 

One thing to keep in mind when using time comparisons is that monetary policy is not consistent. Whether it be moving off the gold standard or the GFC rescue or the Covid response, historical comparisons get corrupted. One of the most interesting graphs I’ve ever seen was the 2020 (or was it 2021?) S&P 500 index price movement but denominated by M2. It’s a flat line, indicating that the rise in a share of the S&P 500 index was the result of growth in M2 and not revenue/profit or any fundamental. Fascinating.

Comment by TakingChances01: I think several of the points you’ve made don’t mean what you think they mean to the economy/markets, some of your points I’d even consider bullish. Also at all those times you cited where the p/e hit 30 and it was already down 15%+, what about this time? We’re at nearly an ATH when the pe hit 30. I also believe you’ve fallen victim to sunk cost fallacy, you’re down on your short position and missed out on a 20% YTD gain in the market so you’re doubling down psychologically and trying to validate it by making this post and receiving confirmation (which isn’t what’s happening).
Comment by a51c30: Increase in P/E ratio cold be explained by the proliferation of index funds and retail investing over the past decade and a half. If more money comes in it has to go somewhere the mag 7 and s&p 500 is a self fulfilling prophecy in this respect. In demand companies get more attention which increases the premium on their shares, combine that with the set it and forget it “invest in everything with the highest market cap” index investing which is the most popular these days and you have an increase in overall PE as the largest weighted companies demand even more money from every dollar put into broad market index funds as the attention and short term performance attracts more growth investors.

Ever heard of APA Corporation? How about Catalent Inc? Well if you bought any SP500 index fund you bought a little bit of that too. everyone has. So there’s a little bump on the premium for those smaller companies there too and as the heavy weighted companies eat up market cap and consolidate with other like minded successful enterprises through M&A you get a lower quality bottom of the list than you had previously, except they’re being bought more aggressively than a long time ago by passive investors who “buy the market.”

The introduction of ETFs, the move to defined contribution from defined benefit retirement plans, and the increased popularity of retail investing created a brand new environment in the market never seen before. Unlike the Great Recession, Great Depression and tech crash, these are not bubbles as much as they are paradigm shifts in how we as a society invest our personal wealth. The market is simply more busy with more players than it has ever been before. That may be something to consider when looking at the increased PE you mentioned.

As for the banks and their losses. These treasuries they hold are the safest investments you can purchase. As such, the banks have the ability to mark to maturity if they can verify their full intent to hold them to maturity. While your right that if there is a bank run there could be forced liquidation and trouble, your wrong in saying there are unrealized losses on their books because these losses can’t materialize in the first place. Regardless, as interest rates are cut these t notes will increase in value.

Now for interest rates. The printing of money does not itself create inflation and the inflation phenomenon is not as simple a supply and demand like many think. The increased supply of money does not create less demand for it and as a result increase prices. It’s increased credit that promotes consumer spending and increased government spending that adds money to the private sector that creates inflation. So to say rate cuts are not possible is not all that accurate and it really depends on whether and when we will arrive at the feds neutral interest rate.

Regional banks have already started to refinance CRE loans and in the event they do fail the FDIC will insure it and a big bank can collect it and consumers will be just fine. 

Our deficit is concerning but not as big of a problem as media makes it in my opinion… the US dollar is the world’s reserve currency,  currencies are pegged to our dollar and central banks hold our dollar in reserves. The chances of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA defaulting on its debt anytime soon is little to none imo ofc. 

Political division has always been there and as long as its not WW3 global tensions wont make countries hate us more than they already do lol. Also, we’re not Argentina lol. We have a sound banking system and print money effectively even though we go over the budget and we’re still in good shape.

Comment by acg7: Thanks for the constructive and fair response... Definitely something I hadn't really considered.
Comment by drumstyx: But...isn't the unequal top-heaviness kinda the point of this stance? If the magnificent seven correct down, say, 33%, which I don't think is particularly improbable, the entire US stock market loses 10%, to say nothing of whatever else might be going on. Movements like that could easily be destabilizing to the whole system. Maybe I'm missing your point though, I'm absolutely not an expert here.
Comment by CanYouPleaseChill: The Magnificent Seven have a weight of over 30% in the S&P 500. AAPL alone has a greater weight than the entire consumer staples sector. Can't just ignore that and say, "Oh, excluding these, the others are cheap". You'll find that many companies besides the Magnificent Seven also trade at silly multiples, e.g. AVGO, TSLA, LLY, COST, MCO. Forward earning multiples mean little when analysts can't even accurately predict the next quarter's earnings.
Comment by Psych_Yer_Out: But he has that in his post as a negative!!! So it has to be a negative, STOP, you are ruining his narrative!!!!
Comment by acg7: This is certainly a fair response. 

That considered -- what hapeens if it falls 10%, 20%, and holds that level for months without recovering. Does the rest of the world still have the same faith in the S&P? Do they continue putting their money there?
Comment by ZmicierGT: Imagine such situation. Aliens arrived to Earth and brought with them a lot of gold, rare minerals and so on, exchanged it to $ and started to invest in US stock market. What will happen next?

That is why it is not a justification that if retail/foreign investors came then insanely high P/E is ok, poor earnings growth rate is ok, trillions worth companies with 0.48% YoY revenue growth rate is ok and so on. It is not ok and in any situation (even on other planet or 1000 years in the future) it will indicate a market bubble. Profits of running business should always be higher than profits of investing in that business because otherwise there is no sense to run that business at all. But currently we are having insanely expensive business which hardly earn any money.

Comment by acg7: Maybe. 

Forward P/E is a fair argument. But I also believe the economy is in far worse shape than what is being claimed, and I think projections for future earnings are inflated. Current earnings have only been achieved by a massive amount of government printing (which eventually made its way into the economy)... and more recently, consumer debt. 

With delinquency rates skyrocketing -- I don't know how much more appetite big banks will have for further extending credit. Furthermore -- the amount of money we printed -- quite simply -- isn't sustainable. Trying to match that level of printing would send inflation back through the absolute roof.

I've made one post regarding the market is going to crash. It was roughly 90 days ago. Certainly plenty of comments... and even a post asking if we were overpriced roughly a year ago. But only one post before this calling a top. 

I'm standing true to that today. 

In 30 days we will have an answer if my timeline was realistic, and in the event I missed the mark, we can see what things look like in December of 2025 which is the only other price estimate I made.

Comment by acg7: Lol -- valid point here. But I don't think they will be able to keep it afloat that long... and furthermore -- SPY could fall $50 by then and they can still claim "Market is great, we are up 10% on the year." 

I think big players all know it is coming. They will not be the last standing on a sinking ship... It will be retail, and people's 401k's/IRA's that left holding the bag. 

Look at Buffet -- He has sold +/- $100bb YTD in shares, while purchasing just $4bb. Smart money is already all on its way out.
Comment by None: That’s EXACTLY what they mean. Thinking the market was overpriced for “awhile” just means you’ve missed out on a massive bull run on any timescale in the last 15yrs.
Comment by Colorshake: Why didn’t you go short 90 days ago then?
Comment by JAG_NG: 2 years or 10 years from now, you’ll be right sometime.
Comment by whalechasin: RemindMe! 60 days
Comment by thelastsubject123: uh yeah it's called ignoring whatever you're spewing and forever investing in VTI. it'll outperform whatever this nonsense is lmao

> I Think BTC follows

100% agree with you. after all, that's what happened in 2022 and 2020. oh wait no it crashed ~~60%~~ 75%
Comment by Thats_All_I_Need: No shot. 

If crypto has long been held up by retail investors. You are quick to point out how people have less money now due to inflation and rising housing costs. If the market crashes and people start losing jobs and need actual cash to buy groceries or pay rent where do you think they’ll get the money to buy crypto? 

Like what am I going to do with BTC? Can’t pay for  my mortgage, utilities, fuel, or groceries with it. 

But hey if you believe it why not just buy BTC? It’s up nearly 4x since 11/2022. Meanwhile BITO is only up 2x.
Comment by Yolo-Nolo: We’ll find out soon enough. Either way, it’s always good to try and inform people of what’s happening using real numbers, so kudos!
Comment by qw1ns: I did a research on past recessions like this [https://imgur.com/nhqz8bc](https://imgur.com/nhqz8bc)

Holding fully 20% GLDM and 70% TLT and 10% cash. Holding long until I see creep in economy.

Comment by Bos35: Just another thought, banks unrealized losses are mostly Treasury securities they were forced to buy when we had ZIRP for so long. All of those bonds will mature at 100% of their face value and will perform very well if we continue to see rates track lower.  They will hold these securities to maturity and receive all of their principal back (plus interest).
Comment by Dan23DJR: Unless the USA stops being the economic superpower of the world, I doubt it. People from across the globe don’t chose the S&P 500 because they’re a big fan of America, they chose it because there’s nowhere else in the globe that offers such a good mix of massive growth stocks and matured global mega corps. For example, I will never invest in the UKs FTSE 100 because it’s comprised of very matured and boring companies that see almost no growth, it’s the same case with Europe. Banks and Insurance dominates. I’ve spoken to people from Hong Kong and China who rather invest in the S&P over their countries indexes for similar reasons and also because you can be certain that business will always be stable in the US, you can’t say that for China/India etc. 

Basically, america is just the most attractive place in the world to invest in because it sees the best growth whilst also being the most reliable and stable. You think a world ending -20% crash for the S&P 500 is bad, look at the S&P China 500. Roughly -28% in 2018, -52% crash from 2021-2022. India’s Nifty 50 has performed really well and stable actually, but even so, they’ll invest in the US. 

Until America stops seeing monster growth mixed in with matured mega corps and pretty much unrivalled economic stability and security, people won’t stop pouring their savings into it. And the strongest military in the world defends that economy’s interests.

Also a side note, I don’t see the US stock markets growth elements dying any time soon either, largely because the best and brightest workers and entrepreneurs in the world all go to America because A) the best and brightest workers get paid better and B) the entrepreneurs with ideas for “the next big thing” go to America because it’s the easiest place to get Venture Capital funding, it’s the startup capital of the world. Conversely, this is an issue for the U.K. and Europe (I know of this first hand), and likely India and China aswell, because there’s a thing called brain drain. It’s a real issue in my country and all of Europe, and it’s basically the concept I just explained. Our nations smartest people leave us to go to America because they can get double, triple the pay if not more. Hence the name “brain drain”, the US hoovers up all the smart people in the world. 

So I don’t personally think that people will lose confidence in the US stock market any time soon simply for the fact that I don’t see any other country becoming a more attractive place to invest in any time soon - Americas closest rival is china, and no one wants to touch Chinese stocks with a 10 foot barge pole (relatively speaking ofcourse).
Comment by AsceticHedonist47: My friend I agree completely with your analysis here, I've come to the same conclusion but don't make posts about it because nobody cares to actually think lol.

Some things you can also add to the pile: 

- Election volatility 

- Israel/Iran Middle East shenanigans 

- VIX futures are now in backwardation 

- Product stagnation. Is anything new anymore? 

- Extreme market euphoria as seen by the last two drops being bought back with aggressive force. 

There is, quite literally, zero arguments for market bullishness anymore. Fundamentals are horrific, companies have lost their growth potential, rate cuts generally signal a recession, geopolitics looking bad as other countries struggle... The list goes on and on. 

Good post! Trade it carefully the timing on these is rough.
Comment by Yolo-Nolo: It’s all vibez all the time.
Comment by ContemplatingGavre: AT&T sucks, the other big ones include Exxon, GE, PG, Chevron, and JNJ. My point stands.
Comment by onepingonlypleashe: Yes.  Use your favorite chart provider to look at the market history.
Comment by dolpherx: I don't mean just shortly after 2008. I mean 2009 to 2024. Are you able to do a report of 2009 to 2024 and figure out what is the average PE ratio of the S&P500? This is because the S&P500 before this period should have a different value than after this period due to various changes in environment, Fed policy, etc.
Comment by sdf_cardinal: You sure about that.gif

ya weirdo
Comment by acg7: I did. 7 $450 SPY P with an exp of 9/19/25, and 5 QQQ $400P exp 6/30/25. I am down pretty heavy on those positions currently.
Comment by 5B3AST5: Why choose VTI over voo, ivv splg etc?
Comment by acg7: I think there are a lot of other factors at play. Continuous money printing leading to dollar devaluation being the biggest catalyst to move into other asset classes.
Comment by WorkSucks135: That seems incredibly risky. What happens to the price of TLT if the US gets a credit downgrade, which seems very likely if the doom thesis is correct?
Comment by acg7: You're not wrong -- I fully understand that the USA is the prettiest horse at the glue factory. 

But if I'm of the belief that we will see a massive, global economic downturn -- which I am -- 

Then

1. There are far less people to purchase the S&P 500, as more people are unemployed  
2. Eventually people realize that the aforementioned horse, while pretty, is still at the glue factory for slaughter. Rather than get clobbered by further losses in the market, they can buy bonds, gold, or even hold cash.

Comment by puterTDI: and here you are still predicting the same thing.

You should take another short today.  You'll make more money that way when it crashes.

Comment by thelastsubject123: It’s like they say: bears sound smart. Bulls actually make money

Best of luck
Comment by Thats_All_I_Need: You’re betting against the military industrial complex that has shown it will go to war to protect the USD. We care about oil and using other country’s oil because oil is traded against the USD. It’s in our financial interest to keep it that way hence continual wars and proxy in the ME to destabilize the region and keep it that way lest they band together and say “we control the oil, fuck the US and their currency.” I don’t think history will look too kindly on us.
Comment by ContemplatingGavre: Ok whatever let’s play semantics. Fact of the matter is look at the top 10 companies today. 100% tech except Lilly and Buffett. It matters and it matters a lot.

Comment by None: Bears make money betting against individual stocks of bad companies. Being a bear is going to get you slaughtered betting against the entire market unless you have absolute dumb luck timing, like 1% chance on selling and buying back, or have insider knowledge about why a weakness in a specific sector will tank the entire economy (financial crisis) in which case you might as well just bet against that sector anyway.
