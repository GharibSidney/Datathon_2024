Title : ENVX: why I like the stock
ENVX and why it will moon

ENVX (Enovix) is an advanced lithium-ion silicon battery manufacturer, and is a first mover with it's battery. They already have 2 smartphone OEMs lined up for 2025, and they just finished their fab2 in Malaysia. They have a patent to protect their proprietary process behind their silicon batteries. They are the first to use 100% active silicon batteries in the consumer market. Competitors cannot just spin up a fab easily.

They are positioned to ramp up production in 2025 with profits coming in early 2026.

They recently raised $100m via stockholder dilution, out of their 168m total outstanding shares. This is roughly only 6% dilution. As of today, their share price has dropped 19%. The $100m dilution along with $200m cash on hand, allows them to survive for 6 more quarters at a minimum, assuming they still continue to burn $50m in cash per quarter, without *any* efficiency gains. That positions that well for the beginning of 2026 play. More partnerships, more customers, lower CAPEX, different segments of customers, will all drive the price up. 

Next-gen batteries and EVs and component manufacturers are a long-term play

I believe ENVX is currently underpriced. As of current price $8.45, my EOY price target is $12, and by end of next year, I see $18 at a minimum.Comment by Bronzehands: Isn't this a SPAC company, and the current revenue consists of the acquired Routejade company, which has nothing to do with this 'revolutionary' technology?  In other words, their new innovation doesn't yet have substantial sales. I'm following the company, but in my opinion, it's not yet a screaming buy stock right now.
Comment by shakenbake6874: Any idea why they dropped so hard on latest earnings? Seems like good news was going around where the fab in malaysia was opened.
Comment by shawman123: Chinese OEMs already have Silicon Anode batteries. We already see them in new Vivo/Xiaomi/OnePlus phones. 

I dont think they have anything that is a stand out. I would not trust the press releases for sure. its a very risky stock for sure. They make almost no revenue at the moment.
Comment by Few-Statistician286: At the very least its an excellent swing trade stock lol
Comment by willxhay16: The phones you are referring to have Silicon-Carbon anodes. This is substantially different to a fully silicon anode, which is what Enovix are working with and manufacturing. In theory, the higher the amount of silicon, the greater the energy density. However, the use of more silicon has its problems as until now, it has been avoided due to the amount that it swells which often leads to poor performance or the batteries demise. This however, is where Enovix are unique as they have designed a battery with 100% silicon anodes, with a system that they've coined 'brakeflow'. This basically is their answer to their inherent problems (primarily the 'swelling') that arise when using silicon anodes.

The amount of silicon in silicon carbon (Si-C) batteries can vary depending on the desired outcome and the preparation method: 

* **Theoretical maximum**A theoretical model suggests that the maximum amount of silicon that can be used in a Si-C anode is 11.68%. 
* **Optimum ratio**A 30% ratio of silicon in the active composite is considered to be a good compromise between capacity and retention. 
* **Carbon content**The amount of carbon in the Si-C nanocomposite can affect its performance. For example, a 58% carbon content can create a carbon layer that coats the silicon nanoparticles. 
* **Trade secrets**The amount of silicon in commercial battery anodes is a closely held trade secret, but as of 2018 it was limited to at most 10%
Comment by tostitostiesto: Perhaps. They’ve stated they have deals with 2 of Chinas top 5 OEMs to supply them batteries.
Comment by averysmallbeing: Yeah I'm in the process of eating away at my underwater position with covered calls to hopefully unload it. 
Comment by shakenbake6874: Where are they at with a workable product? and If they have somehting the works already, where are they are scalability of the product? Do they have a plant to make them at scale? do they plan to contract manufacture it somehwere? Etc. I know literealy nothing about this company I'm just asking these quesitons becuase their product is compelling but I don't know where they are at with their roadmap of their product.
Title : $UBER is positioned extremely well for the future
At the time of writing this post, UBER is down 7% in premarket, which is a big overreaction, after their earnings report. I suspect the cause of the drop is the miss on Bookings, which is not significant in my opinion.

Key factors:

- EPS of $1.20, beating expectations of $0.41

- Revenue of $11.2B, beating expectations of $11B

- Total Gross Bookings of $41B, missing expectations of $43B

UBER had a record quarter, for the first time it generated an all time high GAAP operating profits of more than $1B.

In the conference call the CEO and CFO reiterated that they have a very high standard for doing M&A, so the Expedia deal is not set in stone, rather just a rumor.

They've also stated they are looking to reduce share count in 2025, meaning doing share buybacks, which will in turn drive higher share price.

But what I want to talk mostly about is the AV section.

**AV**

The AV (Autonomous vehicle or self driving cars) is a hot topic right now, especially after Teslas event. Despite Tesla being clearly very far behind actual FSD, Waymo is doing AV, and doing it good. They are partenered with UBER and the AV fleet actually had the highest rated score on the platform (as mentioned by their CEO in the earnings call). Beside Waymo, they are partenered with 14 AV companies, including Aurora which they also have a big stake in. AV is coming, maybe not now, maybe not next year, but it is inevitably coming. And all these AV, especially the smaller ones, need a platform to operate their fleet. Do you build it from the ground up or join UBER who has 25 million rides a day already?

They are also partnered with BYD for the electrification of their fleet. Guess what is BYD also working on? Yeah, thats right, AVs. And judging BYD/China success on doing EVs, I think thats a pretty good chance they will also succeed on the AV side. And since they are already partenered, where do you think BYDs AV fleet will be used? In UBER.

I think the company is positioned greatly for the future, its profitable after multiple years of negative EPS, it has a clear plan moving forward about their free cash flow, including reducing $2B out of their debt by the end of the year. 

Disclaimer, I do have a position in UBER.Comment by AntoniaFauci: I don’t care that much about AV, but agree UBER has a lot more potential than the recent weeks of dumping would suggest.
Comment by Worf_Of_Wall_St: Cutting the driver costs out of rides should make it pretty easy for Waymo to get people to sign up for its own service.  I would be surprised if Uber's brand and habit power means users don't want to buy rides from any other platform.
Comment by DanielBeuthner: Uber stock will half over the next 10 years. Waymo expanded from 0 to 100 000 to 150 000 paid weekly open for all rides in 2 years. Waymos mother, Alphabet is one of the biggest software companies in the world. Honestly - what do they need Uber for? Uber will die or see its margins getting crushed
Comment by notreallydeep: Didn't look at the statements yet and can't for a bit, what made the stock drop almost 10%? Was the earnings beat due to one time effects or was it really just because of bookings? Pretty big drop. Great performance over the year, but still.
Comment by Guilty_Attorney7778: Not sure how big the industry is, but Uber is killing local couriers. I can Uber a document across the city right away at like 1/4 the cost of what a local courier would cost on a same day delivery.
Comment by Straight_Turnip7056: TLDR - dump it.


 AV is the only interesting part and a possible MOAT for Uber, and that's too speculative. Everything else of Uber is like eBay or a cheap classified/ dating app that connects demand and supply. Drivers don't like the 25%+ cut that Uber takes and are switching to local alternatives that have better fees. 


There's also an open source Uber app which is gaining foothold (i.e. Google has invested in it). This is a major threat.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: Longterm Uber cooked, same with any other ride hail service that doesn’t own autonomous/ self driving tech. 

Google/ Waymo will partner with them to learn how to make their own success ride hail, undercut Uber, and then watch them die. 

Unless you own the self driving tech, or have some other moat, you’re cooked. Uber, lift, blah blah, have nothing other than brand name (and most people hate those names), I’ve personally been counting down until I can never use Uber ever again. They suck.
Comment by DrixGod: Waymo will be under UBER in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta, Georgia. They have a partnership. Ofcourse Alphabet can invest and make their own app, Waymo has done that in California, but the issue is the number of users/rides. 150k paid weekly rides for Waymo is nothing compared to 55M rides per week for Uber. It's way harder to attract new users, when you have a platform already built which has all these users already there. And it's available internationally on most countries. Self driving cars will go through Uber as a go-to platform, Otherwise Waymo wouldn't have partnered with Uber.
Comment by DONNIENARC0: It also shot up like 10% overnight a few weeks ago when the Tesla robotaxi event flopped, so it's probably some natural pullback related to that, as well.
Comment by DrixGod: I assume it's that, nothing else mentioned. I have no idea tbh, the earnings looked great.
Comment by DrixGod: Uber owns stake in Aurora, because Aurora was basically Uber before, which develops self driving tech.
Comment by DrixGod: That also got wiped out in the last week. I think the 10% jump for the robotaxi was bullshit, just like this 10% drop now is bullshit.
Comment by notreallydeep: Just checked my portfolio, the drop might also be exacerbated by a general drop in tech, so probably only a small part of that directly attributable to Uber. That would make more sense.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: Stake
Title : Tesla shares jump 6% on profit beat
* Tesla reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analysts’ estimates even as revenue came in just shy of expectations.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $25.18 billion vs. $25.37 billion expected

Revenue increased 8% in the quarter from $23.35 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.85 billion, or 53 cents s share, a year ago.

Tesla’s profit margins were bolstered by $739 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue during the quarter. The company has also been offering an array of discounts and incentives to spur sales.

Automotive revenue increased 2% to $20 billion from $19.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue soared 52% to $2.38 billion, while services and other revenue jumped 29% to $2.79 billion.

Operating margin was reported at 10.8% of sales to improve from last quarter's mark of 6.3%, and top last year's mark of 7.6%. Total GAAP gross margin was 19.8% vs. 17.9% a year ago and 18.0% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.67 billion vs. $3.76 billion a year ago. For the quarter, the EV juggernaut's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 18.5% of sales from 16.1% a year ago.

# 

Tesla had already disclosed 462,890 deliveries for Q3. The electric vehicle maker said it produced 469,796 vehicles during the quarter. Tesla noted that 3% of the deliveries were subject to operating lease accounting. For reference, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in Q2 of this year and 435,059 vehicles in Q3 of last year. Tesla's  all-time deliveries record was 484,507 vehicles in Q4 of 2023. Looking ahead, Tesla reiterated that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.

# More than just EVs

Tesla said energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q3 to a record 6.9 GWh, but were up 75% Y/Y. Overall, Tesla said energy services and other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of the company. "As energy storage products continue to ramp, and our vehicle fleet continues to grow, we are expecting continued profit growth from these businesses over time," noted TSLA. The company also said that it deployed and is training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at Gigafactory Texas, where it expects to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October.

# Balance sheet

Tesla ended the quarter with a cash position of $33.6 billion. The sequential increase of $2.9 billion was a result of positive free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.3 billion during the quarter.

**SUMMARY**

We delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year-on-year, resulting in record third-quarter volumes. We also recognized our second-highest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements.

Our cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle came down to its lowest level ever at \~$35,100. In order to continue accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, we need to make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles – including more affordable models – which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025. At our "We, Robot" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car ownership, and even public transit.

The Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin. Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3.

Despite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.Comment by Rabbit_Say_Meow: Genuinely, I am shocked.

A reminder to everyone that Reddit is an echo chamber that will ALWAYS value polarizing opinions over anything else. Do your own research!
Comment by InsaneGambler: RIP for the smart people that buy puts due to their "technical analysis" (personal bias).
Comment by rotutu8: Here for the Reddit meltdown
Comment by DOE_ZELF_NORMAAL: Volumes is one thing, but I'm mostly impressed by the gross margins considering this is the biggest issue in the market right now. Most car manufacturers are struggling to make any margins while Tesla is increasing their margins while dropping prices. They even managed to get positive margins on the CT while still in the ramp up phase, which is crazy considering the (negative) margins on competitors EV trucks.

If they can keep this up, they are the only western car manufacturer right now whose able to compete with China on EVs and the volumes/market share will follow.
Comment by Specialist-Routine86: Great quarter, did not expect that, Impressive performance on COGS, Megapack and Tesla energy gross margin, as well as Service/Other. 

Although reddit will cry and complain.

"Cybertruck became the third best-selling EV in the U.S. for Q3 " -> remember when they said cybertruck wouldn't even make it to market?

  
another great quarter for the energy business from a business that is "just a car company"....
Comment by callmecrude: Just more validation as to why the average redditor spends their life underperforming the market. The amount of clueless and emotional bearish posts I see about Tesla on here every day is astounding. Even in this comment section there’s already people sputtering nonsense about “just wait the stock will still crater. Elon is cooking the books like Enron hur dur.” It’s lunacy at its finest.

Comment by WarrenBuffettsBuffet: This is going to be such a great post to come back to in 5 years
Comment by tuitcroast: Tesla's growth is impressive, especially in diversifying revenue streams like energy storage. For any eCommerce ventures looking to keep pace with such dynamic markets, tools like Intelis could be a game-changer in optimizing your pricing strategy on platforms like Google Shopping. Success in these sectors often comes down to smart pricing decisions, and every edge counts!
Comment by sadus671: If you look at the investors slides.... A lot of the increase came from operational income (aka software accessory sales). 

This came from the foundation edition CyberTrucks. Since the 20k mark up is counted as operational income.

Now that they are transitioning from Foundation Editions to normal Editions of the Cybertruck...this is going to completely evaporate in Q4...

So.... Watch out for Guidance during the Earnings Call....
Comment by NotTakenGreatName: I made a decision long ago to stay away from trying to play this stock long or short and I feel really good about it.
Comment by tanrgith: Happy shareholder here

Was totally expecting a dumpster fire of a quarter, so to see the exact opposite is great. 

This is also why I don't try to time stocks lol, just buy good shit and hold on through the ups and downs

Tesla is killing it, FSD is truly groundbreaking tech on a scale we have not seen, and they are acing the charging infrastructure game.  Meanwhile Waymo demonstrations still involved a driver hovering the wheel like their lives depend on it, yet Wall Street misinformation experts would have you believe Tesla is somehow not at the forefront of self driving.

Wild.  I continue to profit off this stock wondering why people can't see what I see, but ultimately not caring because I'm here to make myself money- not make strangers money.  People got caught sleeping.

Tesla is polarizing of course, people have strong opinions about it.  

Not a TSLA stock holder
Comment by upL8N8: Tesla's net income is down 32% y/y through the first three quarters of the year.  Not good.

Their original guidance was 50% CAGR from 2020 - 2030.  They were above 50% through 2023.  Through 2024, their CAGR looks like it'll be dropping to around 38%.  If they maintain a similar unit sales volume in 2025, it'll drop to 30%.  Not good.

Tesla has a forward PE of over 72 right now, which will be even higher tomorrow.  Other OEMs, who have performed far better than Tesla recently, are sitting around forward PEs of 5-7.  Tesla's valuation heavily relies on the idea of constant future growth.

Their robotaxi event was generally scoffed at.  Not good.

It was fairly expected they'd beat estimates, and given how shit the stock has been lately, that often leads to a short term pump.  I could see a 61.8% retracement by the end of the month from wherever its high is over the next 1-2 days (probably right around 240, dropping to 222).  Then I imagine it'll pop back up to a lower high around 250-255.  Then, it's likely all down from there, likely back down to around the 160-175 area by beginning of next year... lining up with quarterly sales figures which I don't expect to be spectacular.  Maybe it beats last year, but that isn't saying much when they were previously claiming a 50% CAGR.

Why this stock is worth so much more than other auto OEMs is probably a question a lot of major investors are asking themselves.  A lot of them were betting on autonomous taxis... but Musk can only claim it's 1-2 years away for so long before they eventually start to wise up.  (10 years... he's been claiming that every year for 10 years straight now)

The stock's a dog, Meme investors just don't know it yet.  It's been in a long term downward trend, no doubt supported by a core of buy and hold forever insiders and cultists, and of course S&P index funds that will only sell if everyone else does.

Hell, GM is outperforming it...

Imagine where this company would be if they weren't pulling in $10+ billion in government subsidies and regulatory credit sales every year...

Comment by flareyeppers: To be fair even with this 12% bump tesla is still down for the year while spy is up 20% for the year.
Comment by iqisoverrated: Margins are great (especially in the energy sector...30%...that's *massive*!)...Though I expect the margins in the auto sector to come down again next quarter since the boost from the Cybetruck founder series is now over. But if they can hold at around 15% there then that'd perfectly fine for me.
Comment by Flipslips: Tesla Energy has been killing it.

30% margins. Maxed out production at their current factory and their new factory will be online soon. Absolutely skyrocketing growth

Comment by Init_4_the_downvotes: Everyone should have a bear and bull thesis on a stock they buy. Right now my bear thesis is even though tons of growth is already baked into earnings there are institutions dollar cost averaging and people buying the stock off good news to sell option contracts to people gamboling trump wins the election hoping his connections with Elon will allow for forced scalability backed by government money. If I start seeing a massive influx of option trading in the next several months I'm going to think this bump is temporary and that a new ramp rugpull cycle is here.

Trailing P/E is 60 and they will be growing next year and the following year and have a sizable command of the BEV market, which will grow to overtake most of the automotive market.

Comment by seekfitness: Believe it or not, but most people don’t consider politics when purchasing products.
Comment by pepsirichard62: Someone’s grumpy
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: Plenty of people don't care about the politics. 

The issue is that the politics pushes a certain % of potential customers away, which negatively affects the supply/demand dynamic. 

If a company makes 50 units of a product and there are 100 interested buyers, the company can generally sell its products at higher price and profitability than if there were only 80 potential buyers. 

The question isn't whether Tesla can sell its products.  They can.  The question is: at what price they can sell those products?

I think it's likely that Tesla's automotive margins would be higher if Mr. Musk wasn't alienating potential customers.  Fewer $ competing to buy product places pressure on profit margin

As opposed to paying the same for a shitty Toyota Aygo or €10K a year for a decent ICE vehicle.

Comment by shwaynebrady: 
Idk how people haven’t realized how absolutely detached the market is from reality and fundamentals. This earnings report in no way shape or form justifies a 700B market cap and 60+ P/E ratio. But seeing as Tesla as a 40%+ retail investor and 13% with musk himself, and reading the comments on this post and the ones like it. It doesn’t surprise me that the stock is where it’s at.
Comment by HelloYesThisIsFemale: First stage of grief I see
Comment by lakeoceanpond: Even Carson Block won’t short Tesla.
Comment by Flipslips: Even without the credits they would still make a profit. The credits are essentially just another product for them. Why is that a bad thing?
Comment by throwmeneck: Are people supposed to only buy stocks at ATHs or something?
Comment by Dread_Pirate_Chris: Market performance does not necessarily relate to company performance, and Tesla has a long history of underperforming while people disbelieve their technology and then surging when they actually produce product. 

Wall street in general is skeptical of anything that doesn't have a track record in the financials. Elon Musk's tendency to be make drastically overoptimistic estimates on timelines doesn't help. 

None of that however has anything to do with whether or not they will be a leading EV manufacturer, solve the FSD problem, or produce useful humanoid robots. 

If you think they will succeed on any of those fronts, they are a decently valued growth company. If you think they will succeed on all of those fronts, they are a spectacular opportunity. If you think they'll succeed on none of those fronts, then they're clearly overvalued and  you can go ahead short them.

Comment by IlllIlIIlIlII: cope hard reddit.
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: Considering that YoY, Tesla earned only 185 million more on regulatory credits this quarter versus Q3 '23, it's not a big deal.  Besides, money is money, regardless of source. 

Regulatory credits are a steady, if small, portion of Tesla's income.  They'll continue to be steady revenue because other automakers aren't transitioning to EVs in high enough volumes.    

By comparison, the Energy business generated 2.376 Billion and Services generated 2.790 Billion.
Comment by rlovepalomar: Clean your glasses, ya need to read the report again
Comment by Intelligent_Top_328: GM 17% EXCLUDING credits.
Comment by SexiestPanda: Could just be cause everything that meets good quarters has gone down lately? Idk lol
Comment by Trademinatrix: yup
Comment by bust-the-shorts: I agree with you and would add those margins look like car company margins, not like a tech company’s margins.  When will they start trading at car company multiples.
Comment by rlovepalomar: Their margins arent predicated on reg credits. Cybertruck effectively has had zero credits given its pricing since production has scaled in 2024. Also 30% + QoQ on energy. Rev dipped slightly but auto gross credits are 20%+ and highest reported in 6 quarters
Comment by MaximusBit21: Yet they weren’t. Smash expectations and keep chugging up lol…. Rocket fuel
Comment by Rabbit_Say_Meow: You get it :)
Comment by Ehralur: The CT was also gross margin positive while they're still heavily ramping it. Meanwhile companies like Ford and GM still have more negative margins than Tesla has ever had in their history (although admittedly Tesla only ever had one quarter where they had negative gross margins), Ford is even struggling to get below -100% gross margin on EVs...
Comment by IlllIlIIlIlII: Get out of the reddit echo chamber.
Comment by lakeoceanpond: In a shareholder deck, Tesla boasted that it reached 7 million vehicles produced on Oct. 22nd, and that its newest offering, the Cybertruck, became the third best-selling fully electric vehicle in the U.S., behind only the Model 3 and Model Y.

That’s crazy, in a good way as I’m long.
Comment by Ancient_Persimmon: That should surprise no one. There are some improvements lately, but no model of EV sold in the US has had the kind of production volume to compete with them.
Comment by Specialist-Routine86: Will be for the foreseeable future as they ramp. US EV volume output besides Tesla is quite pathetic.
Comment by rlovepalomar: This is old news
Comment by Ancalagon_TheWhite: It's a very devisive car. Everyone either loves or hates it. Haters will never touch it, but lovers will buy it since there's nothing that looks similar. 

Even if 90% hate it, 5% can't afford it and 5% love it, that would easily make it No1 in the USA.
Comment by SPorterBridges: Not only that, it also outsold its direct competitors, the F-150 Lightning and Rivian R1T, not just this past quarter but also YTD.

Comment by TheRealAndrewLeft: The hype had resulted in IIRC 2 million reservations, but they actually only made sales on a small percent of that and have already exhausted that list. Going into the future would be interesting
Comment by imamydesk: Really makes you wonder how crazy the numbers would've been if they went with a less radical design.
Comment by Obsidianc21: I made 12% gains which I'm happy about. I can't be upset for not taking profits when it hit the 250+

My cash position is low so this bumps it up to 15% of my portfolio. However, I always feel comfortable increasing my positions in msft, goog, amzn and rtx regardless of the price

Comment by cheddarben: TSLA can have a good quarter and Elon can still be a twat.

Also, let's not get too masturbatory about it, as TSLA is pretty far off its ATH while the rest of the market has gone nutso. We can argue that other car companies haven't done great either, but as we have been reminded 5000 times, TSLA isn't just a car company. And don't get me wrong, I am not betting against TSLA or Elon (except on Twitter... I did do that), but I certainly don't have a boner for how he has acted for a very long time now.

This dogshit stock is at half of its ATH and still overvalued. 
The risk hasn’t been worth the reward since like 2020
Comment by callmecrude: Fair, though I don’t put much weight in short term price action. I rode meta from $180 in 2019 all the way up and then down to $90 in 2022. 3+ years to MASSIVELY underperform SPY. Literally down 50% while SPY was up 20%. But then the past 2 years it’s been a top performer and I’m back up 200%+ since buying in while SPY is up 90%. 

Point being that the best time to buy Meta was when it was down and they were going through struggles. Same with Netflix. Same with Amazon. Same with Palantir. Same with Crowdstrike earlier this year. It’s literally just the same thing over and over again. Buy financially sound companies when they’re down and you will do well. Google is going through it right now and is an obvious buy. Tesla will likely be the same, but people hate Elon enough that they’d rather stick their head in the sand than look at the numbers to acknowledge it.

Comment by Pathogenesls: Tesla includes reg credits in their automotive gross margins.
Comment by upL8N8: Regulatory credits are 100% income (100% corporate profit).  Comparing the first 3 quarters of the year, their regulatory income is approximately $700 million higher than the previous highest year.  

They've pulled in about 1.7 - 1.8 billion in regulatory income in each of the last two years.  They're on course to pull in $2.5+ billion in regulatory income in 2024.  It's a pretty massive chunk of their total net income for having to do absolutely nothing to get it save sell the cars they were going to sell anyways.

Their net income through the first 3 quarters is 4.807 billion, versus $7.069 billion last year, or 32% lower y/y.  Remove the $700 million extra in regulatory credits y/y, and it would have been closer to $4.1 billion or a 42% drop in income y/y on their actual product sales.

They're on course to just about match their total unit vehicle sales y/y; they're still a bit behind last year through Q3.  The problem is that their long term guidance which helped lead to the run up (overvaluation) in the stock price is 50% CAGR between 2020 and 2030.  They rescinded that guidance in Q3 '23 because they don't believe it's possible anymore.  To stay even with the 50% CAGR in 2024, they'd have need to sell over 2.5 million vehicles, but they're on course to sell about 1.8 million.  2025 could see little if any sales growth versus 2023/2024.  However, to maintain the 50% CAGR in 2025, they'd have to hit 3.8 million vehicle sales.

Starting to see the problem?  Their forward PE is based on crazy growth guidance, which even Tesla has admitted they can't hit, yet the stock is still trading at a forward PE of over 80.   Most of the major OEMs across the world trade a forward PE of between 5 and 7.

Tesla's sales aren't growing, their revenue isn't growing, and their income isn't growing, which means their PE is based on nothing more than a hope and a dream.

It seems to me that for the second year in a row, Tesla will only see an annual profit on account of government subsidies and regulatory credit sales.
Comment by Fit-Stress3300: These credits won't last forever.

Other companies won't let Tesla drink their milkshake forever.
Comment by Cannabrius_Rex: Money is money, but it’s a trash accounting trick to inflate what is there. It’s especially dumb because they just didn’t need to do that. They could have followed proper accounting rules
Comment by LackToesToddlerAnts: What part of what I said contradicts with the report?
Comment by WINTERGRIFT: Muskrat is going to take us to mars.. once he gets bored of Twitter I mean X
Comment by upL8N8: Regulatory credits are the carbon credits they sell.  It's not the federal / state EV tax credit.  They don't count EV tax credits anywhere since they don't receive them directly.  Although... I'm not sure how that applies to leases, tbh.

Their regulatory credit sales, counted as 100% profit margin, are $700 million higher than last year through the first 3 quarters.  In Q3, regulatory credit sales accounted for 34% of their total net income.

Tesla once again lives on subsidies, whether they're paid by the government, or other OEMs are forced to pay them to Tesla through regulations... which essentially points out just how excessively Tesla's vehicles are subsidized.

$7500 federal tax credit

$1500 - $5000 state tax credit

Hard to say how much they're getting from EV regulatory credit sales per Tesla sold, but my guess would be around $2000 per vehicle.

Add it all up, and Tesla could be getting subsidized on 25%+ of the total sale price of their vehicles.

(EV tax credits benefit Tesla in that Tesla can raise their MSRPs to offset the value of the tax credit, thus taking an equivalent amount of revenue / profit)
Comment by Specialist-Routine86: People don't like these facts, truth is its hard to profitably make EVs. Rivian and Lucid are prime examples, because they can't hide their loses through profitable ICE sales.

Comment by Cannabrius_Rex: Makes sense with its obscene price tag and absolute trash build quality.
Comment by skoldpaddanmann: I'm curious if it will remain so. Word is they already burned through the 1m+ pre-orders, and only converted 25k orders total. The website shows I can custom order one and have it in 2 weeks so there doesn't seem to be any remaining backlog.

Comment by Ancient_Persimmon: >Now that they have no more waitlist they've slashed the price $20k to drive orders in Q4.

They were supposed to do that in July, but waited 2 more months because they still had demand. 

In all likelihood, this will be the 4th worst quarter in the Cybertruck's lifespan.
Comment by largespacemarine: Not really, you see one maybe once a week and I live in a rich part of LA. I see way more new Tahoes.
Comment by Ehralur: Just for people reading this and being surprised: it's nonsense.

Tesla had 2 million reservations for any type of Cybertruck. They've exhausted the amount of people who wanted a foundation series for 100K, but they're now moving on to the 75K AWD version and there's still a cheaper version coming at some point. People who didn't want the 100K version get to keep their reservation for the cheaper models.
Comment by Pathogenesls: I would say the last 6 is really when the stock became the first memestock and disconnected from fundamentals.
Comment by skilliard7: Tesla's growth has slowed down considerably though. GM is growing earnings faster than Tesla and yet they're valued at 5.6x earnings while tesla is 60x earnings.
Comment by Pathogenesls: Well they don't have autonomous robotaxis and they won't, so baking that in is worth $0 and energy storage is only a tiny part of their revenue.
Comment by Fit-Stress3300: Usually stocks of companies with growing revenue...

Tesla growth is lagging what would be expected for such premium.
Comment by Pathogenesls: No they don't, what I'm saying is that the current price is what the price would be after 10 years of strong growth (and still pricing in the future growth).

Comment by shatters: Agreed. I feel the only reason Tesla is as successful and profitable, even compared to other EVs, is because stock they can beat most cars, even "muscle" cars, in a 1/4 mile drag.  As you state, it’s all about the performance, not just the arguable eco-friendly stuff.
Comment by TheIguanasAreComing: Nice cherrypicking lol
Comment by Climactic9: You were previously using the price movement of a single day as validation yet now you are dismissing the price movement over the course of a year because it is too short term. Cognitive bias?

All of your examples had pe ratios less than 20 during their crashes. Tesla is at 60 right now.

It is not the same thing over and over. Cisco, blackberry, and IBM were all financially sound yet their stock prices never recovered.
Comment by Climactic9: Down over the past 3 years. Up big over the past decade, but reddit hasn’t been bearish on tsla for a decade. The bearish sentiment is more recent than that.
Comment by upL8N8: I mean... he's down over 90% from his total asset valuation. That's definitely worse versus where he could have been.  

Buy and hold forever investors in meme stocks.  Gotta love 'em..
Comment by tech01x: Ah, yes.

There will still be take rate of FSD and other accessories too. And some of that bundle wasn't delivered, and so couldn't be counted in revenue, but is in deferred revenue. And the chunk of that revenue that is FSD can only have a portion counted right away, the rest of it is in deferred revenue.

But yes, overall margins will drop on a per Cybertruck basis, but if they hit their 510k+ volume goal, they will hit a new revenue record.
Comment by TheIguanasAreComing: Ironic
Comment by VirtualLife76: Yes, yes you should.
Comment by TIectric: Well even with your point, if you assume all tesla buyers are Elon cult members, wouldn't they then believe in climate change like their cult leader does?

If you believe they are trump supporters, surely you aren't naive (or stupid) enough to believe every single person who is going to vote for Trump believes the exact same things?
Comment by HelloYesThisIsFemale: Stock bad because arbitrary reasons 🤓☝️
Comment by WarrenBuffettsBuffet: but he has to bitch about it because the prospect of it happening threatens his intellect
Comment by HelloYesThisIsFemale: 30% annualized return over the last 10 years is a victory lap.

You shouldn't punish upside volatility that's like saying "if your stock doubles then halves again in a day then you lost" even though it nets out to zero.
Comment by Dread_Pirate_Chris: Yes, but the US is a fraction of the global market -- a significant fraction, but still. And EVs are a small fraction of the global market. 

Being the top share of a mere 5.4% of global sales (2023 BEV sales, I don't count hybrids as 'EVs') isn't that big of a fraction of the global automobile market. 

The question is, will Tesla still be the leader or at least a strong 2nd place when EVs are 98% of the market. (There will always be hobbyist and specialty use ICE vehicles, so it'll never be 100% but it should be close. If you don't believe EVs are the primary future of passenger vehicles, you probably shouldn't be in Tesla in the first place, but there are hydrogen believers. Still.) 

FWIW, I think it's a strong probabilty that they will be. China is the only real concern, I don't see any serious challenge to Tesla dominance coming from anywhere else. On the other hand, China is doing well, and a government-backed Chinese company has ... not quite unlimited funding for expansion, but ... a *lot*. 

There is a real risk though that Tesla is regulated into failure in the US and Europe as political revenge for Elon's activities, Tesla's anti-union position, or both. If not actually shutting Tesla down with red tape, then subsidizing some competition that otherwise wouldn't be a viable threat. 

There has also always been a real risk that Elon says something intemperate that wrecks the China relationship; China has a history anyway of letting foreign companies in to learn their technology before regulating them out or subsidizing the locals enough to push out the foreigners. It didn't happen that way to Apple and may not happen that way to Tesla if they also export enough Chinese-made product to be a net benefit for the Chinese... there's reason to be hopeful. Provided that Elon doesn't retweet any Winnie the Pooh memes, of course.

Anyway, I'm not selling my TSLA position, and odds are IMO reasonable, but it would be a mistake to think that dominating the emerging market in any way guarantees dominating the mature market.
Comment by tech01x: The long term trajectory is in play now... which is a return to growth in 2025.

The financial metrics are good, so regardless of short term movements. Sure, it'll give up some gains, but then probably push back up since plenty of folks are offside.
Comment by onions_lfg: Thoughts now?
Comment by akintheden: They said auto margins (ex reg credits) went from 14.3%to 17.1%
Comment by Intelligent_Top_328: That IS EXCLUDING credits. It specifically said so.
Comment by tech01x: Income is growing ex-regulatory credits.

You're just griping now.
Comment by 34554323454ttttt: >It seems to me that for the second year in a row, Tesla will only see an annual profit on account of government subsidies and regulatory credit sales.

You can call them subsidies all you like, but traditional automakers are able to not report billions in expenses on their income statements because they externalize the cost of pollution and global warming. This is simply leveling the playing field, albeit probably in a nonoptimal way.
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: >Their forward PE is based on crazy growth guidance, which even Tesla has admitted they can't hit, yet the stock is still trading at a forward PE of over 80. Most of the major OEMs across the world trade a forward PE of between 5 and 7.

Forward PE is high because enough major investors still have faith that Tesla's AI efforts could result in profit margins much higher than would be possible on just hardware alone. 

**If Tesla's AI efforts fail, the PE will collapse.**  I've projected that Tesla is only worth $60-$70/share based on vehicle + energy systems alone, which is [a downside of around 70-75% from today's market cap](https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLALounge/comments/1coec01/comment/l3hdpkq/).



>Their net income through the first 3 quarters is 4.807 billion, versus $7.069 billion last year, or 32% lower y/y. Remove the $700 million extra in regulatory credits y/y, and it would have been closer to $4.1 billion or a 42% drop in income y/y on their actual product sales.

Are you willing add back in the 622 million in one-time restructuring charges from last quarter as well?  

Some factors will be transitory.  

It is odd that people are arguing against the regulatory credits counting towards anything, given the small size but consistent presence.  Growing sales of credits, are an argument against them going away in the near term as a small source of revenue

Comment by helloworldwhile: You can go and short first.
Comment by Ancient_Persimmon: Tesla themselves said in 2022 that they expect to see sequential declines in regulatory credit sales going forward, but they clearly underestimated the incompetence of their rivals.
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: I don't think Tesla is counting on those credits lasting forever, nor should they really care.  

Looking at page 26 of the shareholder slide deck, total revenue for Q3 '24 was  25.182 Billion of which 739 million was regulatory credits.  

* That's 2.935% of their total revenue.  Not a lot.  If it evaporated instantly this would have no practical effect on their expansion plans
   * Operating cash flow was +6.255 Billion and free cash flow +2.742 Billion.  The company has a war chest of 33.648 Billion in liquid assets. (page 4 of slide deck)

Tesla will sell the credits as long as they can.  Why not earn $ when it's there?  But they are certainly not running their business like they need the credits.  It's clear they don't
Comment by helloworldwhile: The problem is that no legacy company is profitable with their EV division. In fact they are pulling money away. They are all hoping for trump to come over and change the rules or the game at the federal level.   
I don’t know how likely is for congress to approve it. But let’s say they do, legacy automakers won’t be able to innovate and move into the EV market.
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: I'm not a CPA, but why does it matter what line the regulatory credit income is located?  

If Tesla categorized it under "other", it would still show up as part of their net income.  This doesn't "inflate" anything when looking at the end result of net income.  

Since the carbon credits are directly tied to sales of vehicles, it makes sense to include them under revenue from business operations.  If Tesla doesn't make and sell cars, they can't get the credits.  This isn't like interest income where $ in the bank compounds even if the company does nothing.
Comment by Ancient_Persimmon: Gross margins are up and those credits don't count towards that.
Comment by Affectionate_You_203: It’s excluding regulatory credits
Comment by Affectionate_You_203: And the cope continues. That’s your cope for how fast it became profitable but what is your cope for why it is already outselling all other EVs on the market? The only cars beating it are other teslas. Lmao
Comment by Flipslips: Wouldn’t the huge majority of the backlog be for the cheaper 40k model? Sounds like they still plan for a cheaper RWD model, though I doubt it will be as low as 40k. Maybe 50 or 60. Either way, I have to imagine most people reserved the cheaper one.
Comment by lakeoceanpond: Time will tell. Impressive feat, even if short lived.  Tesla said in the release that the Cybertruck “achieved a positive gross margin for the first time.”
Another impressive act. A culmination of all things Tesla has done over the years I feel.
Comment by tech01x: You would be listening to idiots then.
Comment by Affectionate_You_203: They big mad

Comment by Affectionate_You_203: They were lied to by people/corporations who have ulterior motives
Comment by hoopaholik91: I think it's a commercial failure. Their stated goal was to produce 20m vehicles a year. And maybe you could have seen that being possible considering their sedan and SUV became the best sellers in their segment, ICE or EV. Yet the Cybertruck is just a footnote in the overall truck market. Why they just didn't make a normal truck like they made a normal SUV and sedan is beyond me.
Comment by Flipslips: Have they officially binned that 40k model Cybertruck? Or is that still upcoming? I’d assume they start at the highest price and work their way down, but I haven’t seen any sort of official confirmation if it’s still coming.

Comment by AoeDreaMEr: Agreed. There are many bets that could potentially pay off for Tesla. At least, Elon convinces investors that way. Tesla builds its own hardware and software, so they are unique that way.
Comment by tech01x: Check GM's EV earnings... oh, yeah, it's negative, even on a contribution margin basis. Going forward, only their EV earnings matter. Everything else is going to get nuked.

Comment by ButthealedInTheFeels: What do you mean cherry picking? Since 2020 when the stock went parabolic from the extended short squeeze, devoted cult like retail “investors”, and then funds getting in on the action, the stock has been dogshit.    
It is currently overvalued for the amount of actual growth we have been seeing and the competitive landscape on the horizon… 
Vaporware shit like the robotaxi and even moreso the stupid van and humanoid robot are just to keep the cult hyped. 
These small bits of positive news which was largely due to regulatory credits (as per usual) are not the big win the fanboys are saying it is.  

If you had just invested the money in SPY since like 2021 you would be waaaaay ahead of TSLA performance.  That’s a long time and not just cherry-picking one or two quarters.
Comment by r2002: > You were previously using the price movement of a single day as validation

Stop, you're making too much sense.
Comment by keridito: IBM is ATH at the moment, how it never recovered?

BB was financially sound in a market that changed radically in 2 years, and they didn’t have the capacity of adapting to the changes. Pretty much what is happening with traditional automotive companies.
Comment by callmecrude: I’m using the fundamentals of this ER to validate my point… you were the only one who brought up the daily price movement.

They showed a massive bump in margins which have been the source of doubt for the past year+. They showed energy generation and storage is still growing exponentially and reaffirmed future growth. They had a huge earnings beat, and signalled that increased energy credits will likely continue as competitors have failed to keep up. These are all massive points to consider when building/updating a DFC model. No disrespect, but you’ve unintentionally proven my point here by bringing emotions into it by calling me biased instead of just objectively looking at the company fundamentals that were released today.

> all of your examples had PE ratios less than 20 during their crashes

Amazon had a PE of 200 during their struggles in 2013 and has never had a PE anywhere near 20.

Palantir has never had a PE anywhere near 20 in their existence, and it was at a forward PE of 200 when they were struggling

Crowdstrike has never had a PE anywhere near 20 and had a PE of 300 when they were struggling and dropping earlier this year.

For “all” of my examples to have a PE below 20 it’s odd how most of them don’t.

Edit, because rereading your comment I’m getting more lost:

> It’s not the same thing over and over. Cisco, blackberry, and IBM were all financially sound yet their stock prices never recovered. 

IBM is literally at all time highs so I don’t have a clue what you’re referencing there. And calling blackberry “financially sound” after their crash is a bit of a stretch given that they were losing billions of dollars a year and completely abandoned their phone business.

Comment by hoopaholik91: I would love to hear the accounting on that jump...
Comment by upL8N8: Tesla also pollutes, albeit not as much over the life of the vehicle.  We really don't know what long term environmental impact the mining sites for the battery materials are having though, or what front-loading a high load of emissions is having, such as the difference in manufacturing a BEV w/ a large battery, versus manufacturing an ICEV / Hybrid / PHEV.

Sure, traditional OEMs don't have to report the billions in from environmental damage, however, Tesla's vehicles don't all run on 100% renewable energy, so they too benefit from not paying for environmental damage caused by the electricity production their cars use to move.

I'm all about carbon taxes and taxes on practices that damage the environment to level the playing field, and preferably to move more people way from owning / driving personal vehicles so much.  It's the only fair way to go about it IMO.  Key is that a carbon tax would actually give a huge benefit to people who ride public transit, ride bikes and PEVs, work from home, or in those workers at businesses that implement 4 day work weeks.  Something the EV subsidy programs aren't doing.

Plus, carbon / environmental taxes impact all facets of life, not just transportation.  From the amount of electricity we use at home, the amount of hot water we use, the foods we eat, the things we buy, etc...

The government is spending a LOT of money on a solution that's doing far too little.   The regulatory credit policies are, IMO, not having the impact they were intended to have.  Their primary result has been to build cash in Tesla's coffers and make Elon Musk the richest man on the planet, and starve other initiatives of much needed capital.

Hell, we could have spent the $30+ billion in subsidies that went to Tesla painting bike lanes and had a much larger environmental impact.
Comment by upL8N8: Sure... it's still an AI play... which obviously hasn't kept the stock near their all time highs.  It's been in a continous downtrend since the stock peaked in 2021.

It does beg the question though, how can a project with an endless timeline ever truly fail?  Afterall, FSD has been claimed to be 1-2 years away from completion for 10 straight years now.  Millions of Robotaxis were going to hit the roads in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and now 2025...  If they fail 2025, it'll be 2026, then 2027.  Meanwhile, other real services are already operating, so investors' claim of Tesla instantly enabling robotaxis and quickly gaining a monopoly on not just autonomous taxi services, but all taxi services, instantly wiping out millions of taxi driver jobs...is a bit far fetched.

The more we really consider the complexities, the more unrealistic it sounds.  Hell, Musk is now saying that 2025 will only see robotaxis in some regions of Texas and California... not the nationwide rollout he originally claimed with a simple OTA update.

Then of course there's the hardware concerns... now the claim is HW3 may not actually be able to operate the software.  New cars are on HW4... and now Musk is claiming an HW5 is coming that's well beyond enough power to operate a robotaxi... the same thing he said about HW4...

How about those robots though... those look anywhere close to ready to anyone?  I mean, they were talking to people at robotaxi day... even if it was a human talking through a speaker...

Why would I add back in $622 million in restructuring?  Did they not benefit this quarter and part of last by not having to pay wages to all the people they laid off?  They laid people off because their demand wasn't where they needed it to be, and had they kept those people on staff, Tesla's financials would have been in far worse shape right now.

As I've mentioned in my comments, $740 million in net profits from regulatory credit income on a total net income of $2.2 million isn't a "small size".  It accounts for 33.5% of their total quarterly profit.  And that's just the regulatory carbon credits... it doesn't include federal / state EV tax credits, solar tax credits, battery storage tax credits, tax abatements, etc...
Comment by gymbeaux4: Their AI efforts will fail. Most humans on this planet wrongfully believe that OpenAI (ChatGPT), Google and others are on the precipice of Skynet-level intelligence. 

I work in this space as a software engineer alongside much smarter people than I, and we all agree it’s hype. And that’s the *legitimate* stuff. Then there’s the obvious deception and theatre, like those Tesla “robots” who will do “whatever you want them to do”. It’s snake oil. 

I could tell you all about why Teslas will probably not achieve FSD anytime soon, even in the next 20 years. 

Even ChatGPT is just a “let’s take an approach first conceived of in the 1970s and throw a bunch of data and modern hardware at it”. The results of this are clear as day- ChatGPT is confidently *wrong* all the time. That it isn’t aware of anything that’s happened in the last, say, year- that’s a hint that the training process is very “expensive” for them to do, so they aren’t doing it until they absolutely have to. It’s held together with duct tape like so many military vehicles and bank software and other things that literally make the world run.
Comment by Fit-Stress3300: Part of that is because ICV sales are holding better than expected.

And traditional car companies not having the guts to take 2 or 3 years of increasing Capex to be able to transition to EV.
Comment by upL8N8: Just to repeat from my last comment, and add a bit more info, regulatory credit isn't simple revenue... it's 100% net income... 100% profits.

739 million is 33.6% of Q3's net income.

Keep in mind, a massive chunk of their remaining net income comes from government subsidies.  In the US for example, they're still seeing $7500 federal tax credits on a large percentage of their total sales which allows them to maintain higher MSRPs, translating into higher profit margins.  Most of their sales are in states with state EV tax credits as well, often in the $1500-$2500 range.  Some as high as $5000.

Their energy sales are even more subsidized than their car sales.  The federal government subsidizes something like 30%+ of the overall cost of a solar panel / home battery storage installation.  States with the highest rooftop solar adoption rates often have additional incentives on top.  Overall, it can reach up to 50%.  

I'm not sure on their grid scale power storage, but I'm guessing the subsidies and/or the amount they're charging the government, which often has mandates written into law to have storage installed, are lucrative.

Like 2023... if Tesla were to exclude regulatory credit income and government subsidies from their income, they'd likely be reporting a loss for 2024.  I guess this doesn't technically matter unless there were a risk that the subsidies were going to disappear in short order.. which there's no sign of.

Some headwinds for Q4:

* They've removed their lowest priced trim model 3 near the end of Q3, which had the imported Chinese LFP battery.  That could hit their overall sales numbers in Q4.  It also means they're not going to sell cars with the significantly cheaper LFP packs, which likely generated some decent profit margins.  These units didn't qualify for the full tax credit on sales; although I do believe they still qualified on leases, which Tesla would have had to roll into the lease price.  Not sure if they did or didn't do that.
* They significantly cut the price of the Cybertruck and still don't seem to have a backlog after the price cut; per their estimated delivery dates on their site.
* They've significantly cut the prices on their inventory vehicles.  Model 3s I've seen have up to $3k discounts applied.  Model Y has as much as $4k discounts applied.  Model Y accounts for the majority of their sales.  That said, they were also aggressively discounting inventory vehicles last year in Q4.
* They're offering 0% financing offers; which I believe is new this year.  While this won't impact their unit sales, it will mean additional losses of up to $5k per vehicle over the course of the loan that they otherwise would have made on interest.

I do expect Tesla to break their sales numbers from last year, if only because they're so deeply discounting their vehicles.  However, I expect their revenue and net income to be down in Q4 y/y as a result of their deep discounting.
Comment by Fit-Stress3300: I don't see Tesla keeping those margins AND growth at the same time.

The business of paying premium for an EV because you are environmentally conscious and/or wanted to be on the bleeding edge of technology is over.

Elon tarnished the brand with half of the US - and more of the people with resources to pay the premium.

Tesla has no moat nor secret sauce. 

Unless Elon plan to control Trump is successful and they become the only viable EV manufacturers in America.
Comment by Pathogenesls: Tesla does actually count the credits towards their gross automotive margins. It's one of the biggest criticisms of their accounting.
Comment by Cannabrius_Rex: It’s how it’s become profitable. They cut many many corners. Bottom line, they sold those dumpy trucks. So despite the atrocious build quality to make profitability possible, consumers are still buying. One of the benefits of cultivating a cult for your base. That’s good for investors, as long as they understand their investment
Comment by Affectionate_You_203: Especially impressive when you realize all other EV trucks are still not profitable even though they’ve been out for years
Comment by skoldpaddanmann: You can check their website right now. You can order any truck trim and get it in 2 weeks which is the minimum time on a custom order. I would imagine if there was still a backlog that would be higher. 

If the overwhelming majority of people who were interested enough in the truck to pay $100 to reserve it pass on it I'm curious how they will convince normal people to buy it especially considering how much worse the specs are than the announcement specs.

Comment by Dynasty3310: Yes it is beyond you, that’s why you’re not CEO
Comment by ImStupidButSoAreYou: What would make it not a failure in your eyes?

They are less than a year into ramping production and have been these selling things for over $100k until very recently. Clearly it's in demand. It's already profitable, and they've already scaled faster than any other EV truck. The numbers will only improve as they scale production, make it more efficient, and lower the price to increase demand, as we have seen with every other vehicle Tesla has made so far.

And in the grand scheme of things, pickup trucks are only a thing in NA. It is ultimately like 5% of Tesla's projected 20m/year vision.
Comment by SkynetProgrammer: I read once they had a backup plan if Cybertruck was a failure, but there is currently demand that they still cannot produce enough to meet.

Why would they release a normal truck in that situation?
Comment by relevant_rhino: The RWD model will come out at something like 60k (guess). 

I doubt we will see a 40k model. Maybe in a couple years when market is saturated we will see something around 50k that is basically 40k if adjusted for inflation.
Comment by Affectionate_You_203: It’s now 50k after federal rebate and inflation but it’s coming out in a few months
Comment by Ehralur: I find that hard to believe, but from what I could find so far it does seem like you're right. Does make me wonder how long they'll wait before releasing the RWD, as a $60K car has about 3x the market size as a $80K car. Ultimately they might need the $40K version after all, with ~10x the market size.

Comment by Pathogenesls: Lol, no shit. Now imagine you didn't calculate cashflows, assumed 10 years of growth happened magically overnight and then reprinted the stock for a further 10 years into the future. That's Tesla.
Comment by RonTom24: This stock ran to an insane valuation way too soon, it's not that the company hasn't delivered since then, it's just that it is taking time to grow into the lofty valuation the stock market assigned it in 2020/2021. The p/e ratio back then was over 1000, it's not Elon or the companies fault that the stock market got so frothy and speculative investors ran the price so high.
Comment by -bluff: thats fair, i was just pointing out that using an arbitrary date to reflect your point doesn't show the full picture of the stock. elon has managed to drag the tesla brand into a lot of his own personal ideations and it is reflected in the stock price/brand image.
Comment by New-Connection-9088: It's up 1,394% over a five year period. Isn't it interesting how a different narrative can be painted based on the time frame.
Comment by TheIguanasAreComing: You again are cherrypicking time periods, why did you choose 2020 and 2021 but not 2015?
Comment by Climactic9: I actually didn’t know that ibm finally hit their ATH after a decade of stagnation. That doesn’t change the fact that it would’ve been a shit investment if you had bought it after their dip.

In hindsight the reasons why a company like bb failed become obvious. It is much harder to tell before/during the downturn. It remains to be seen if tesla’s growth and margins has the capacity to adapt to the changes in the ev market.
Comment by Climactic9: I will admit, I jumped to some conclusions and exaggerated some things. However, “Cognitive bias?” = emotional is a bit perplexing. 

Black berry crashed in 2008 and saw stagnant stock price during 2009-2011 even with solid financials while the rest of the market was climbing. People thought they were undervalued. Nope. 

IBM hit an all time high after a decade of stagnation while the rest of the market went on one of the biggest bull runs in history. 

Tesla could end up like one of these.
Comment by upL8N8: Of course it was.  It just hadn't realized its potential yet.
Comment by TheIguanasAreComing: 
“Ironic (n.): A situation where you’re forced to deal with excessive amounts of iron, like tripping over a wrought iron fence while carrying a bag of iron supplements, only to realize your shirt has an embarrassing iron-on decal that reads ‘I’m a master of fate’.”
Comment by TheIguanasAreComing: Not grief but copium, Tesla is an excellent company regardless of if you think it is overvalued or if Elon is unethical.
Comment by relevant_rhino: Yea because money is money. Arguably, it coming from competitors not meeting emission goals is even better.
Comment by anthonyjh21: Yep, gotta remove those one time, 44 consecutive quarters of reg credits...
Comment by jwrig: If only they had some sort of framework they had to use for accounting, and that we had an outside firm audit their accounting practices and controls so they just couldn't get away with making things up...
Comment by imamydesk: You should look up cradle to grave life cycle assessments, rather than relying on "hey industrialized production has a non zero amount of pollution too so aha! Gotcha!". Spoilers, increased costs of battery production is broken even within a year or two of driving.


Oh and, there are also lots of such studies assuming charging on power grids that's fossil fuel based. Spoiler again, even in a purely coal powered grid, EVs are still better.


At some point you have to 1) educate yourself on this environmental matter you seem to be passionate about, and 2) step away from the sort of all-or-nothing logical fallacy.
Comment by 34554323454ttttt: >Tesla's vehicles don't all run on 100% renewable energy, so they too benefit from not paying for environmental damage caused by the electricity production their cars use to move.

Moot point. As you acknowledge at the beginning of your comment, Tesla pollutes far less than its competitors. With advances in battery and solar tech, this discrepancy will only grow.

>I'm all about carbon taxes and taxes on practices that damage the environment

I have already stated that the subsidies that Tesla receives are a nonoptimal solution to the problem of external cost accounting. 

>and preferably to move more people way from owning / driving personal vehicles so much.

Politically unfeasible.
Comment by gymbeaux4: I used to work for a guy at a global logistics company. We were tasked with building something that had never been built before, using Machine Learning(TM).  The idea is simple. The theory is pretty simple. The actual construction of something that is as good or better than a human at performing a job…. Very difficult. We did not succeed and the project was cancelled. Now we were a motley crew to say the least- most of my coworkers were Serbian and frankly not very intelligent. Nevertheless, I don’t foresee the “brightest minds” solving the problem. I equate the problem of having a computer do human tasks (like driving a car) to putting a man on the moon, curing HIV, or harnessing nuclear fusion. The THEORY is straightforward. The implementation often requires the literal invention of new elements and materials (in the case of NASA’s Gemini, Apollo and Space Shuttle programs).

So we know at a high level how to “build” FSD. I guarantee the guys at Tesla working on it have the “theory” nailed down. The implementation is what they are struggling with. Like driving, **perfection** is required to get people to and from space safely, cure HIV, or harness nuclear fusion. This is not shit that can be wrong half the time (or even 20% of the time) like ChatGPT. ChatGPT is child’s play compared to FSD. Elon being an arrogant idiot failed and probably still fails to realize why FSD is more like “nuclear fission” than “BonziBuddy”.
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: >And that's just the regulatory carbon credits... it doesn't include federal / state EV tax credits, solar tax credits, battery storage tax credits, tax abatements, etc...

People like to pretend these don't count because they aren't "fair" on some political grounds (libertarians in particular seem to hate Tesla due to the company having tax code advantages) or because they think these are temporary.  That is denial of reality.  These sources of income exist and they are not going away anytime soon.

>It does beg the question though, how can a project with an endless timeline ever truly fail?

When the investment community stops believing and the markets stop considering Tesla an AI stock.

I don't know exactly when or how that could happen, but at some point, people could lose faith and Tesla's 800+ Billion market cap would deflate.  I can see some scenarios:

* A competitor like Waymo achieves FSD first and takes over the space entirely.
* Tesla itself writes off Billions of dollars of AI training hardware if it becomes apparent that current Neural Net software methodologies are insufficient and the datacenters they set up are useless.  I've seen similar writedowns in the biotech space:  a company finds that their path on a project is on a dead end and they sell off all the equipment for that project.
* Governments deem Tesla's AI projects to be dangerous and either regulate them out of existence or seize them outright.

I believe that for the next few years, TSLA will continue to inflict psychological (and possibly financial) harm on everyone:

* TSLA bulls with blind faith in Musk will insist that the company is much more valuable than its market cap, and be continually upset by erratic earnings and uncertain progress with no guarantee of success.
* TSLA bears who hate the company will keep harping on its market cap as overinflated and be continually upset by the multi-hundreds of Billions valuation.

Most people IMO should avoid having anything to do with TSLA either long or short.  I actively tell anyone I know to avoid TSLA.

* The vast majority of people I know who had anything to do with this stock from 2011-2020 lost money, and a lot of it, no matter how they tried to play it.
Comment by gymbeaux4: Yeah people are still buying ICE vehicles. Any legislation that forces Ford et al to move away from ICE and towards EVs will be bearish for TSLA
Comment by Flipslips: I mean auto margins were up 3% to 17% (ex reg credits) and Energy margins are 30%. That’s pretty major. And Elon has been off the rails for at LEAST a year or two now. At what point will things start taking a turn down?
Comment by stoked_7: Its third-quarter profit margin from vehicle sales, excluding regulatory credits, grew to 17.05% from 14.6% in the prior three-month period, according to Reuters calculations.
Comment by LackToesToddlerAnts: Thank you sir.
Comment by None: [removed]
Comment by Affectionate_You_203: You sound like the people in 2010 on the internet saying Apple was a cult and list 50 different reasons why the iPhone is a crap product compared to Android
Comment by tech01x: There's a crap ton of people waiting for some clarity on a few things, like the $7,500 tax credit. Once they get their new cells with new cathode material, it should allow for the $80,000 version to have a $7,500 tax credit.

Just because some people can get in line and get theirs in a couple of weeks doesn't mean everyone can.

The specs are extremely competitive against other BEV pick up trucks. It doesn't matter much how it competes against the pre-COVID specs. What matters is how it competes today.
Comment by Affectionate_You_203: I’m long as well. Almost 1000 shares. Reddit makes me laugh with their shit takes. They’ll post pics of their posts years from now asking how no one seen it coming that Tesla would blow up to be the biggest company in the world.
Comment by hoopaholik91: > It is ultimately like 5% of Tesla's projected 20m/year vision.

And yet 5% of 20m is one million. Even the F-series only sells 750k a year at this point. A 60k+ steel box is never going to sell like that.
Comment by hoopaholik91: If their production capacity is only 15k trucks a quarter, then that only reinforces the point that they decided to make some weird concept car instead of something actually mass producable
Comment by JerryLeeDog: Why is this extremely accurate comment downvoted?

Are people that fucking butthurt?
Comment by skoldpaddanmann: Personally I don't think the RWD will be made unless demand is unreasonably bad. Musk cancelled the promised SR RWD model y because of low range, and the RWD trucks range is lower then that was going to be if I recall correctly. I imagine the real world range is well under that 250 range estimate. 

I think you are right though if they brought a low cost electric vehicle to market it would sell like got cakes. However they don't seen to interested in that. Musk let it slip on the call there new 30k vehicle in development is actually 30k post credits which means it's basically a grand or two cheaper then the 3 is now. 

Also as I said earlier their marketing strategy seems to be to promise a low cost model at announcement, but cut it before production.
Comment by tech01x: Clearly not.
Comment by AoeDreaMEr: 5 years late comment.
Comment by Low-Possibility-7060: I’m with you here. The robotaxi is already reality - it’s made by waymo.
Comment by Scuczu2: Ya just looked at when it first hit this price
Comment by keridito: I think BB and IBM are very different cases. While the IBM case is more complex (they survived the PC era thanks to their mainframe business and supplying PowerPC for Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony game consoles, and lately Quantum Computing has made them to be relevant again), whoever invested in them and kept it during this time, in the end they have been rewarded. And looking at the graph now, from an ATH of \~200 they went down to \~100 in 2020 and they are now at 230. Not too bad. And considering they are one of the most important actors in quantum computing, they will probably continue growing at a good pace.

Blackberry is a completely different story. It is true that before the turndown, no one saw it coming. Essentially, no one saw the iPhone coming. Once the iPhone was out, it was clear from the first day that it was a game-changer. Every possible actor had to react very quickly or die sooner or later. The most evident victims were Nokia and BB. 

Google was able to react quickly by removing the keyboard from Android. The first versions did not support virtual keyboards (I guess everyone remembers Steve Ballmer laughing at a phone that cost $ 500$ and didn't even have a keyboard). 

It took them a few years to move to Android, and by then, it was way too late.

I didn't have any shares on BB back then, but I would have dumped them shortly after seeing that the only BB business model was no longer relevant and that they were not reacting to the changes.

With Tesla, although it is clear they will not keep growing the way they did before, it seems unlikely that today they will follow the path BB took. Together with the Chinese EV manufacturers, they are the reference right now. And Tesla has other businesses besides the cars that make them relevant. The influence of Musk is another story, though.
Comment by Bronze-Soul: Lots of effort but no cigar. 
Comment by BenMic81: Well, the thing is it’s a political and transitory part of margin. If legacy automakers shift to electric or regulatory credit regime changes then that margin goes away quickly. 

Not a catastrophe though as Tesla would be profitable anyway and stock prices of Tesla have nothing to do with realistic earning outlook but fantasy of future things to come.
Comment by Pathogenesls: It's not industry standard and it's why their gross automotive margins look so inflated.

Gross automotive margins should just be the ratio of revenue from sales of vehicles to cost of goods sold for their automotive business. It should not include revenue from sales of other items such as regulatory credits.
Comment by iqisoverrated: But, but but...the competition is coming? /s
Comment by yhsong1116: yes, free factories.

"Competition" is really charity
Comment by AyumiHikaru: and bigger than ever

LOL
Comment by upL8N8: Cradle to grave assessments don't cover things like mining.  I've been in the EV community and been researching this topic for a very very very long time, bud.  There are certainly unknowns that are never mentioned or covered, which is why I mention those things out in my comments.

For example, I didn't say "increased cost of battery production".  I specifically noted the high front loading of high emissions.  Why did I mention this?

The planet can only sequester so much carbon over a given period.  What happens if we significantly increase the amount of carbon we produce in a given year on account of a manufacturing process that spikes the levels of emissions?  What are the impacts to the environment?  Does it result in more ocean acidification, because the CO2 is sucked up by the oceans instead of the forests?  Thus leading to devastation of coral reefs and oceanic plant life, and styming the Ocean's ability to sequester more carbon? Again, not something covered in cradle to grave assessments..

Sure, power grids are changing... slowly... and will continue to do so over time.   That doesn't mean there aren't significantly better solutions to the environmental problem than simply "MOAR CARS!".  We're to the point where every bit of CO2 we inject into the atmosphere will likely require more energy and time to suck back out of the atmosphere in the future with CO2 sequestration processes.  IMO, the best solution is to not emit in the first place.  We, humans, need to drastically reduce our carbon footprints in a very short period of time.  

BEVs help, never said they don't.  Dollar for impact... they're about the slowest solution for reducing global emissions.
Comment by gymbeaux4: I don’t see how you can lose by shorting TSLA, you just have to be patient. Bill Gates is a famous TSLA perma-Bear. Imagine the people he has access to- PhDs whose sole jobs are to develop machine learning have probably told him how unrealistic FSD is. After that it’s a simple matter of comparing TSLA the automaker to the PE of the other automakers.

If you aren’t in the AI/ML space it’ll seem like a black box, and a “coin flip” on whether TSLA truly creates full self-driving. For the rest of us, we know the odds are “more likely not”. 20 years from now, maybe. 5 years from now? Hell no. I put it at around a 3% chance they “figure it out”.
Comment by jwrig: Waymo isn't going to replace fsd.  Waymo requires geo fencing and months of training within that geofence. You can't drop a waymo in the middle of a city like Topeka Kansas and have it start working.  You can however drop a Tesla in Topeka and it starts working.
Comment by Fit-Stress3300: Well.
Growth has stalled for about 2 years now.

If you think Tesla is a energy company, so it should have the multiples of a slow growth Energy Company.
Comment by upL8N8: Tesla's net income is down 32% y/y through the first three quarters of the year, and that's considering that they've sold $700 billion more in regulatory credits this year over that period

$7.069 billion -- Q1-Q3 2023

$4.807 billion -- Q1-Q3 2024

Excluding the $700 million in additional regulatory credit sales this year versus last, Tesla's net income is $4.107 billion in 2024, which is 42% lower than last year.
Comment by Cannabrius_Rex: Have you looked at the dozens of videos with these cultists making excuses for catastrophic failures while driving slowly in a straight line. Or slamming their door shut and it peeling apart when they try to open it again because it’s all plastic junk on the inside? I absolutely believe it. Look at the cult following for Trump while he is objectively a terrible business man and garbage human. Cults aren’t rare guy, humans are deeply susceptible.

There’s also no shortage of wealthy idiots
Comment by None: [removed]
Comment by skoldpaddanmann: I checked several area codes around the US, and everyone was 0 additional wait time. It's been pretty widely reported the reservations appear to be done for at least a few days now, and haven't seen evidence otherwise. 

Have they ever talked about the cells again since battery day? The last thing I have heard about them is they are just a much larger and slightly worse battery than the smaller form factor. I haven't seen anything that they have actually achieved the breakthroughs they expected years ago for the most part.

If all these recent price cuts across all models and 20% price cuts on the truck it's probably better to wait for more cuts rather than credits. Plus you won't get hit with that bonus depreciation from future price cuts.
Comment by ImStupidButSoAreYou: You're moving the goalpost and making an unverifiable claim.

90% of pickup truck owners have virtually no need for a pickup truck, yet here we are. People often buy unreasonable things en masse.
Comment by skilliard7: Only 6.8% of new cars sold in the US are EVs... consumers don't want them. Even with huge taxpayer subsidies and affordable prices, Americans still choose normal ICE based cars.
Comment by TheIguanasAreComing: :(
Comment by tech01x: Not transitory. Folks have been claiming it is transitory since 2009. And yet... here we continue to be.

There regulatory credits come from the EU, China, US CAFE GHG, CARB ZEV, and others. Legacy automakers are doing a piss poor job of meeting ever more stringent emissions standards across the globe. If anything, the regulatory credits are likely to increase over the next few years.
Comment by imamydesk: > If legacy automakers shift to electric or regulatory credit regime changes then that margin goes away quickly.


Well that's kinda like saying "if a competitor can sell the same product cheaper the demand goes away". You can say that about ANY company.
Comment by relevant_rhino: I agree
Comment by relevant_rhino: Hehe yea, it's not industry standard because no one in the industry except Tesla has enough to sell them in volume.

These are not made out of thin air (maybe out of clean air), but are a direct result of EV sales.
Comment by tech01x: It is a part of the auto industry. There is no reason to count it separately.
Comment by imamydesk: https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/14/11027


"Resource extraction".


Not long enough it seems, bud.
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: >I don’t see how you can lose by shorting TSLA, you just have to be patient.

That was the common wisdom several years ago when Tesla was close to 11 Billion in debt, with massive loan repayments continually looming (the SEC filings disclosed note amounts, interest rate, and maturity dates), and a manufacturing operation that seemed perpetually in chaos.

"Structurally unprofitable" was what the vast majority of financial experts were saying.

Except we know that it didn't end well for those betting against the stock:

[https://www.advisorhub.com/ubs-top-wisconsin-broker-face-23-million-claim-over-tesla-short/](https://www.advisorhub.com/ubs-top-wisconsin-broker-face-23-million-claim-over-tesla-short/)

>*A UBS financial advisor in Madison, Wisconsin who oversees a 35-person team “repeatedly promoted the idea of short selling” shares of the electric car company Tesla, Inc., triggering* ***more than $23 million in losses*** *for four couples—all members of an extended family—and another investor, according to an arbitration claim filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.*

>***“His recommendation focused on his conviction that lots of money would be made because Tesla common stock was overvalued and certain to lose its value,”*** *the plaintiffs argued. “No balanced view of the risk of loss was provided by Burish.”*

It is extraordinarily reckless to reach such conclusions with absolute certainty.

The people who are so sure they "can't lose" are the ones who get wiped out.

That goes for the ultra bulls too.

* Plenty of TSLA shareholders got wiped out by margin calls when Elon Musk repeatedly betrayed and stabbed them in the back with open-market share dumps in late 2022.  He kept lying saying he was done selling TSLA stock to fund the Twitter buyout, only to keep selling TSLA stock over and over, driving the price from over 400 to near 100.  

You think you can't lose.  **You have a chance lose it all, no matter which side of the stock you're on.**
Comment by rgl9: You can drop a Tesla in Topeka and FSD will crash the car unless the driver takes over
Comment by Flipslips: Sure. But that could be several factors such as an aging product lineup, tough macroeconomy, supply chain issues AND/OR Elon going off the rails. 

However, Cybertruck is now the third best selling EV, behind the Model 3 and Model Y. So sales are not so stagnant. 

I do think Tesla is also an energy company. In fact it becomes less and less a car company every quarter. Energy growth was 52% YoY. 30% margins. 

“Other” revenue (energy, etc) accounts for over 20% of revenue now. That’s pretty huge.

Edit: I’m listening to the earnings call right now and they forecast 20-30% car volume growth next year, probably thanks to lower cost model launching in first half of 2025.
Comment by Affectionate_You_203: “The internet told me”

You realize that companies who want you to believe their competition is bad and failing can use the internet to curate narratives to try to sway people’s opinions right? You also realize that the internet is not real life and the people you see posting all the time are not representative of the average person?
Comment by Affectionate_You_203: People love apple no matter how much android fanboys online flood threads with hate. Tesla is the same. People love their teslas and the model Y is the most popular car in the world for a reason. Just because the majority of people have a different opinion than you, it doesn’t automatically equate to CuLt!
Comment by Affectionate_You_203: My reservation is for the RWD version so how on earth could you claim they’re done with all the reservations? Also the tax credit is on hold right now while the government drags their feet on certifying the new 80k model that literally just became available a few days ago.
Comment by hoopaholik91: RemindMe! 1/1/2030

God I feel old
Comment by olavk2: 21% plugin hybrids and 14% regular EV in europe... then you also have places like norway that hit 90% ev sales... China also has around 50% ev sales iirc.

Just because the US is lagging behind, does not mean there isnt a trend towards EV. 

Many consumers want EV for the lower fuel costs, but cant afford the initial buy in of EV (im one of those people, and i know more like me).
Comment by BenMic81: In 2035 there will be no more new ICE cars in the EU. That’s a “at the latest” date for the regulatory credits there.
Comment by BenMic81: No it’s not. In the EU no more new ICE cars will be allowed after 2035. There’s a difference between state ordered subsidies to competitors that have a virtual end date and normal product competition.
Comment by Pathogenesls: It's not industry standard to include anything other than the vehicle sale price in the calculation. It's just one of the more egregious accounting tricks that Tesla uses to make it's financial health look better than it is.
Comment by largespacemarine: Uh no that's completely incorrect.
Comment by upL8N8: You're referring to extraction of fuel.  When it comes to BEVs.. it's extraction of raw materials (metals) AND fuel (in the event the power plant is using fossil fuels).
Comment by upL8N8: Also, I find your complaints a little odd; given that the first line of my original comment was:

"Tesla also pollutes, albeit not as much over the life of the vehicle. "
Comment by ResearcherSad9357: Several years ago Musk wasn't jumping up and down on stage for a fascist.  Computer scientists and college grads in general skew left.  Tesla is a ticking time bomb, which is why Elon is acting so very desperate.
Comment by gymbeaux4: That was a lot of text for you to type out just to list the top two paradigms of the stock market:

- past performance does not guarantee future results
- nothing is a “sure thing”
Comment by jwrig: Maybe, maybe not, at least it moves unlike the waymo.
Comment by Fit-Stress3300: Yeah....
But the margins of the best energy companies in the world would not justify Tesla valuation.

There is a fundamental reason tech company can have their multiples. They don't deal with products and productivity limited by physical materials.

But faith and belief can last a long way, specially when you become too big to fail.

I have no idea what would take to bring Tesla price down to where it "should be".
Comment by upL8N8: CT is the third best selling EV... which isn't saying much.  It's still seeing low quarterly unit sales.  Tesla's also recently lowered prices (or at least no longer requires an expensive package which consists of software and what's essentially a few cheap pieces of plastic/metal), and it's pretty clear from their order page that there's no backlog remaining for this vehicle.  At least, not at these prices.  We also know that CT sales seem to be cannibalizing model S/X sales... or maybe S/X customers are just going the way of the dodo, and new buyers came in to buy the CT.  Maybe a mix of both.  Either way, they're trading two high cost / potentially high margin vehicles for one.

Cars still make up the lion's share of their revenue.  Both divisions rely on large orders of cells.  One can't exist without the other.  If car sales slow down, Tesla offloads excess cells through their energy division.  It just so happens that their energy products are subsidized to a much larger percentage than their vehicles.  How large the overall market is for their energy products is anyone's guess.  Frankly, Li-ion isn't exactly the most cost effective way for storing energy in a static location.  Solar roof seems to generally be a failure of a product.  Ironically, their powerwall sales would likely be far lower if they actually allowed V2L capabilities in their non-CT vehicles.  It's a a conflict of interest for them to enable V2L capabilities in their vehicles, which is kind of silly when you think about it.  They're screwing the customer intentionally to pad their own pocketbooks.

I imagine 'Other' revenue may have been FSD.  Remember that near the end of the quarter, Tesla started offering 0% financing, but only if you bought FSD.  It essentially made FSD cost like $1k or something after all was said and done.  Early in Q4 now... Tesla's removed that requirement and is now just offering 0% financing on their model 3 and Y with no need to buy FSD.  They're also discounting their model 3 / Y inventory by $2k - $4k.

Not listening to the earnings call so don't know what he's saying about their forecast, but I doubt it...  Without a new lower priced model, or deeply discounting their existing models, their market isn't large enough.  We don't know where the economy will be next year, but it could certainly worsen.  It seems calls for a recession aren't as large as they have been, but I can certainly see some economic troubles.  Growing credit card debt, credit card defaults, and auto loan defaults don't just magically go away.

The real question is where will this magic increase in volume come from?  30% volume growth is an additional 540,000 vehicles produced and sold.  They have no new factories under construction AFAIK.  I can't see CT sales volumes growing much without significant price cuts, and I definitely don't think they'll be selling over 100k of them next year.  Much like the F-150L, I think there was the initial pent up demand, but once it's out, it's going to be a long slog to growth in that sector.

Also, where are they planning to grow their sales?  The US?  Europe?  China?  I'm guessing China, where they very well may be expanding; haven't heard much news on that front lately.  However, if they're expanding, they're expanding at a time when all of the Chinese OEMs are also rapidly expanding.  Somehow I don't think Tesla's market will grow by 440k units in China in one year.  Although... I mean China just enabled their government to buy Tesla vehicles... the first foreign brand they've ever enabled that for.  China also seems to be abnormally beholden to Tesla for some reason.
Comment by Cannabrius_Rex: Video evidence told me, but nice cope. I see you’re a conspiratorial type. You also like Joe Rogan? Lol
Comment by Cannabrius_Rex: I didn’t say every person using Apple is in the cult. Same with teslazis. Are you purposefully making obtuse arguments or are you actually serious? You seem to think I’m here to hate on this stock which is objectively doing really well for its investors. This is a solid investment BECAUSE of what I’m saying. You’ve got a cult backing up this stock. It can perform terribly and it won’t matter. Just like right now it’s obscenely overvalued but that doesn’t matter. This isn’t tied to fundamentals, it’s tied to a cult.
Comment by skoldpaddanmann: I thought the RWD was cancelled a few months back as you can't even order them anymore. Tesla usually never makes or barely makes any of the base option they advertise like the cloth seat 3, or the SR Y. Think they did it with the S and X as well with small battery sizes but less sure. They do it so they can advertise a super low future price point they will never meet like the 40k truck.

Comment by skilliard7: Why is Tesla's sales growing so slow then?
Title : Looking to dump some stocks before the end of the year specifically RIVN. Looking for insight, please.
As title states, currently holding RIVN and it is down about 66% since I purchased it. It's sitting at just over $10 a share. I was holding onto it hoping that the likely booming EV market would include RIVN, but doesn't appear to be the case for a variety of reasons.

So, just curious as to what others think. 

I'm definitely a novice, but have had an etrade account since 2020 and have experienced a decent overall return. 

RIVN is currently on the chopping block. 

Please and thanks. Comment by MyAccount2024: As someone who has a lifetime of experience with this exact situation ... just understand if you sell now, the stock will run up to levels you never imagined ... if you hold, the stock will keep falling.
Comment by overitallofit: Buy the same number of shares you have now, in 30 days, sell your original shares.  Take the tax loss and you've lowered your cost basis.

This is assuming you still like the company and it's in a taxable account.

Comment by notreallydeep: If you're looking to dump it, dump it 🤷‍♂️
Comment by west-coast-engineer: Only reason to hold at this point is if it is a small % of your portfolio and see what happens when the R2/R3 start to roll out. I am still holding some after selling a bunch at a nice profit when it was in the high teens. The remaining lots I have are tiny and down. I've already done my tax loss harvesting for 2024, so if you haven't done that, this is one use of selling them. Otherwise I plan to hold for another 2Q at most. If they can turn a profit, the stock will rally violently and stabilize. The main issue they have is losses per vehicle. That is just bleeding money.

If I were your portfolio manager, frankly I'd ask you to sell it, and use the proceeds to buy Li Auto if you want to invest in EVs and hybrids. Look at their financials plus you get the potential of the China trade. This is what I did following selling my RIVN and I am up very significantly and I think it has way more room to run.
Comment by TSLARSX3: All I’m going to say is I’ve seen more rivians then gm ev hummers
Comment by dvdmovie1: 2020/21: Bubble where everyone thought every EV company was the next Tesla. 

2024: A number of EV companies that went public via SPAC or otherwise in 2020/21 have gone bankrupt (some for the second time) and others have been obliterated. 

I think there's a decent chance that RIVN is one of the few smaller companies that gets through this difficult period but what does the other side of that look like? I think it could be okay but will probably disappoint a lot of people's expectations. I would be surprised if it ever gets back to the peak. In the short-term, how low does it get before a rebound? There's a view that a Dem victory would be positive and perhaps it is initially, but everyone also thought in late 2020 that green energy was a "sure thing"/"easy money" and piled into it only to have January 2021 be the top in things like ICLN. 

I think too many people are still looking at EVs like it's the 2020/21 disruptive growth bubble while the market has returned to the view that the auto industry is a competitive, cost intensive and generally not great business and EVs don't change that. I mean, look at Aston Martin flirting with 0 again (would be bankruptcy #8.)

Musk has said countless times over the years that the auto industry is an incredibly difficult business and that Tesla has narrowly avoided bankruptcy at times. The automobile industry has not been good for investors, with a couple of noteworthy exceptions: 1) Ferrari, because it's an ultra high end luxury company that happens to sell cars  and 2) Tesla, because of - whether you like him or not - Musk.
Comment by tbill1000: Take a look at BYD, Chinese EV’s that have the lions share of their market and expanding.
Comment by KCV1234: It’s pretty simple, you either think they are a good company or not. Read the quarterly reports, balance sheet, understand their financing and debt, who owns and what are they doing with it, and what the future of the EV market looks like and premium cars. 

If you haven’t already done that, you probably shouldn’t own individual stocks at all. Going to Reddit with a what should I do here and no details is a red flag to your financial future.
Comment by thejumpingsheep2: RIVN isnt going to do anything until their new factory is online. That wont be till 2028 according their estimates assuming they make it till then. Obviously investors are getting tired of the cash burn and how slow they are moving toward profit given they knew what it would take. I like that they are careful but its well known that you need scale to turn a profit. That should have been top priority over a new platform. In other words, they should have started working on that factory 2 years ago.

There is probably little to no reason to invest in RIVN right now. Might as well wait till 2026 unless you are fishing for a buyout.
Comment by SweatyArmPitGuy55: I’m no expert but over the last 20 years I’ve seen some strange things in the market. The most recent cvs/walgreens failing. ( most of their clients died of Covid-19 ) 

Are you so hungry for something else that RIVN is worth a loss ( nobody likes a loser) their cash management is not the best but yours might not be as well. 

You can slowly enter into something else over time and the pain is way less than buy all now and wait (then you can stay current on that companies status, never buy a share without looking it over first). 

As long as you have extra money coming in you can always add more to what peaks your interest……if you sell “All” now (I’d sell half at a time if you need the money for rent) you could very well be entering another turd.

The question you really need to ask yourself is why you really need the money???? Apply yourself in real life services to make as much money as you can and then take that extra and invest it. It takes time in the market to gain and RIVN as well as the money you threw at it are only a few years invested.

I see Rivian vehicles driving around where I live so that’s a start. Most EV is having trouble getting parts right now (I believe TSLA is prioritized based on sheer volume of the parts they need; that’s how businesses work.) but TSLA can’t monopolize the market and not everyone will want a Tesla but they are the cheapest but still not as profitable as Mercedes Benz.

Don’t just make a decision, think about every aspect of everything you are doing because if you do make the correct choice Uncle Sam will be sitting there waiting to take his cut so plan ahead……..heck it’s only money!!!
Comment by Coloradodreaming1: Why did you hold so long as that is a big drop to stomach?  If you sell immediately to tax loss harvest and buy it back on 30 days you may miss the rise in shares if the Dems win in November which will likely be good for EVs and green energy companies.  Might want to wait it out since you’ve waiting this long and the election is less than a month away.  If you are sick of the name and seeing the red in your portfolio move on after the election because there are better opportunities.  If you like the name buy the equivalent share amount now and then sell the expensive shares in 31 days to tax harvest.  The R2 might change things like the model 3 did for Tesla reaching profitability so it’s worth the risk to me.  Good luck to you.
Comment by gregsapopin: They only make pick ups and SUVs they aren't interested in innovation, only chasing customers.
Comment by iiiiiiiiiAteEyes: I would think that buying RIVN to hold it for a few months or a year or even 2 years is a stupid move, is it not something allocate a small portion of your portfolio to and hold for 5-10 years hoping they figure things out? The rewards if they make it seem to far out way the risk.
Comment by Shot_Ride_1145: I hope that it is a small portion of your portfolio. I am at -84% at the moment, it is a relatively small part of my portfolio but I am keeping it as it is, "a loser and small impact". 

I have seen a RIVN vehicle, and they do rock, unlike a TSLA, so there is that. I haven't bought one so can't say that I fully support it. But, I think this EV stock will go up. Just don't know if it will go up as much as we both hope it will.

Investment wise, you are better off in Market Index ETFs, or if you are into individual equities, I would suggest the following: AAPL, COST, GOOG(L), JPM. Or, just keep your RIVN and add those to your portfolio.
Comment by litex2x: Op should let us know when they sell
Comment by puterTDI: Op, please let me know if you sell do I know to hold.  Thanks.
Comment by Kooky-Information-40: Yeah, I've thought about doing it that way.
Comment by Warm_Bedroom_1556: Good one
Comment by Kooky-Information-40: I've never done calls. Would like to learn how as I have time on my hands lol.
Comment by manofjacks: How can he sell covered calls if he's down about 60% for his cost basis? He'd have to sell a call higher than his basis which would be $16+, which would net nothing
Comment by Kooky-Information-40: Wow, thanks. I'm going to put that info to use.
Comment by mammaryglands: What you're suggesting they do is impossible, and you're silly for suggesting it
Comment by Kooky-Information-40: That's true. A few years ago, it seemed like they were poised to be a leader. Now, not so much.
Comment by Kooky-Information-40: Oh, this loss doesn't make a dent, really.  My portfolio is up 25% ytd and 20% since 2021.
Comment by None: [deleted]
Comment by D1rtyH1ppy: You should have 100 shares to write a covered call. There are other ways, but I wouldn't recommend them for starting out. Look at a website like optionsprofitcalculator to see what you would get for the CC.
Comment by PM_ME_DANK: InTheMoney on youtube is a great resource. Make sure you understand all of the greeks and what they mean before you start
Comment by gamer_gurl_: Would need a lot of time.
Jan $16 going for 0.32.
3% of current value, and if it does run…he gets the extra 3%.
Comment by Shot_Ride_1145: So we are in the same boat. I am keeping my RIVN, not because I think it will get green, but because I believe in the cause.
Comment by tnmoi: If my money is on one, I would and have it on RIVN.  LCID is only an offshoot of Tesla.  I have purchased more since it fell to teens.  And I am waiting for it fall sub $10 to pick up even more.
Comment by Kooky-Information-40: Wow, thanks so much
Title : Shell Plc - What are your thoughts?

This one caught my eyes, because I'm a believer in the *Great Rotation*, and sooner or later, over-coverage fatigue will set-in with A.I and tech stocks. Not to mention, the power hungry data centers can't be fueled alone with solar or wind. Traditional energy is here to stay. This is also a good diversifier in tech-heavy portfolios (that we all have).

I'm also a half-believer in *energy transition* bandwagon. This (should) sound like almost a propaganda to anyone with analytical mind of 12 year old. Renewables are fine as a "top-up" source or to smooth out peak demands. EVs - where do they get their power from? Much of logistics, happening with trucks and ships, still remains dependent on oil & gas. It's plain science. A battery simply won't have enough juice to pull a truck load or power a ship across oceans. Just one litre of fuel packs more than 10 units of energy (3 hour charge at 3 KW).

Now specifically for Shell Plc, a few things caught my eyes -

1. Q3 guidance and better refining margins outlook
2. Expected severe cold winter in Europe 
3. $3.5B buyback and juicy 4% dividend yield 
4. Historically low valuation, with rising crude/gas prices Comment by AutoModerator: Welcome to r/stocks!

Comment by notreallydeep: >better refining margins outlook

It's the opposite, they released an updated outlook literally today. Q3 refining margin $5.5/bbl vs $7.7/bbl in Q2.
Comment by RogovoiStarik: If you like swing trades, get at it. If you want to hold long term, stay away.
Comment by BlueSonjo: I was in Shell for a couple years and made a profit since I got in at a low, thing that made me leave is that this company and the European oil majors are hated by the public and the governments and there is outsized risk on that. 




Activist investors, apologetic CEOs, protesters, governments wanting to make landmark cases out of them, everyone is out to get oil industry in Europe. Shell was just one after the other with these news. Half their official statements were basically apologising about the business they are in, and European oil majors are massively divesting and their operations keep gett8ng more expensive due to various initiatives from those I mentioned before. 




I am European and I am not a climate change denier, so I am not saying this from a Merica Fuck Yeah perspective, just pragmatic investor.





They have great economics on paper for a reason. They are attacked in creative ways on the regular and seems like everyone who works there is half ashamed.
Comment by dvdmovie1: I'd rather Canadian Nat Resources or Tourmaline in Canada. Both well run and have actually delivered some material share price growth over the last 5 years. As for dividends, Tourmaline has paid a special dividend every quarter (in addition to its regular dividend) every quarter since 2022.
Comment by tyurytier84: Rycey
Comment by No-Champion-2194: Shell is not a particularly low cost producer, and has a shorter reserve life then peers.  Add this to the overall volatility and cyclicality of integrated oils, as well as a general hostility to fossil fuels in Europe, and this doesn't seem to be a great long term investment to me.  For long term energy exposure, I think a US based midstream play like EPD gives better prospects for long term steady returns.
Comment by 00Anonymous: I need a ham sandwich for lunch.
Comment by greenpride32: Agreed.  There was a time (decades ago) you could by oil and gas stocks for captial appreciation.  That ship has long sailed.  When oil prices are depressed buy up the stock, hopefully the dividends are retained or not cut too bad, hold 1-3 years and sell when oil peaks.  Rinse and repeat.
Comment by Straight_Turnip7056: That's Dutch lifestyle. Pure energy, no shnik-shnak.
Title : European Union votes to impose tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles
Share price of Chinese EV companies generally decline after the release of news below ...

&#x200B;

**European Union votes to impose tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/04/european-union-votes-to-impose-tariffs-on-chinese-electric-vehicles.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/04/european-union-votes-to-impose-tariffs-on-chinese-electric-vehicles.html)

&#x200B;

*Key Points*

* *The European Union on Friday voted to adopt definitive tariffs on China-made battery electric vehicles (BEVs).*
* *“Today, the European Commission’s proposal to impose definitive countervailing duties on imports of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) from China has obtained the necessary support from EU Member States for the adoption of tariffs,” the EU said in a statement.*
* *The EU added that it was still working in China to look for “an alternative solution” even as the tariffs are adopted.*

&#x200B;

*The European Union on Friday voted to adopt definitive tariffs on China-made battery electric vehicles (BEVs).*

*“Today, the European Commission’s proposal to impose definitive countervailing duties on imports of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) from China has obtained the necessary support from EU Member States for the adoption of tariffs,” the EU said in a statement.*

*It added that the decision marked another step toward the conclusion of the Commission’s anti-subsidy investigation into electric vehicles from China, which was launched in October 2023.*

*The EU first announced that it would slap higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports in June, on the grounds that they benefit “heavily from unfair subsidies” and posed a “threat of economic injury” to electric vehicle producers in Europe.*

*Duties were also disclosed for individual companies that linked to their levels of cooperation and information they supplied to the EU as part of the bloc’s probe into EV production in China.*

*Provisional duties were put in place from early July.*

*The European Commission then revised its tariff plans in September based on “substantiated comments on the provisional measures” from interested parties.*

*A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce told reporters that Beijing continues to believe that the investigation into China’s subsidies for its electric vehicle industry has come to “pre-set conclusions,” adding that the bloc is promoting unfair competition.*

*On Friday, the EU said it was still looking for other solutions, even as the tariffs are adopted.*

*“In parallel, the EU and China continue to work hard to explore an alternative solution that would have to be fully WTO-compatible, adequate in addressing the injurious subsidization established by the Commission’s investigation, monitorable and enforceable,” it said.*

&#x200B;

*Industry response*

&#x200B;

*German automakers criticized the EU’s decision.*

*Mercedes Benz called the tariffs a “mistake” and urged the European Commission to delay their implementation, while BMW said the move marked a “fatal sign” for Europe’s auto industry, Reuters reported. Crisis-stricken Volkswagen meanwhile called on the EU and China to continue talks about the issue, saying that an alternative solution was still possible, according to Reuters.*

*Swedish auto maker Volvo Cars, which is owned by China’s Geely Holdings, said that it would “continue with our long-held strategy of building our cars where we sell them and have committed significant long-term investment into Europe,” according to a statement.*

&#x200B;

*Division in the EU*

&#x200B;

*The decision comes after months of debates and deliberations between EU member countries, which have expressed varying opinions on increasing tariffs on imported Chinese made EVs.*

*While France has been a big supporter, previously pushing the EU to start investigations of potential tariffs, Germany has advocated against them, raising concerns about consequences for its own struggling car makers.*

*German Finance Minister Christian Lindner on Friday urged the European Commission not to start a trade war.*

*“Despite the vote for potential punitive tariffs against China, Ursula von der Leyen’s EU Commission should not trigger a trade war. We need a negotiated solution,” he said in a post on social media platform X according to a CNBC translation.*

*Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said Thursday his country would veto a proposal from the European Commission that puts forward tariffs of up to 45%, Reuters reported.*

*Potential retaliation from China has been a key concern for some EU members, especially as China has already launched anti-dumping probes into pork and brandy exports from the EU, as well as an anti-subsidy investigation into EU dairy products.*Comment by AutoModerator: Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.

Comment by wearahat03: Since some people are confused on why german automakers are against this.

Chinese market % of Germany automaker revenues

Mercedes 35%, BMW 30% and Volkswagen 27%.

Volkswagen has the largest share of EU market, BMW and Mercedes are the in the top 5.

Any minor sales gain they make in EU will not compensate for the larger potential loss in the China market from retaliation.
Comment by justwalk1234: So this tariff meant to benefit EU carmakers, but the carmakers are really against this. So who does it benefit?
Comment by faratto_: Prices of chinese batteries will increase then, gg to costumers and companies like stellantis that already struggle to have some
Comment by notreallydeep: Step 1: Proclaim an EV future.  
Step 2: Ban ICEs.  
Step 3: Impose insane tariffs on cheap Chinese EVs.  
Step 4: ???

Pretty much all I've been hearing these past years is how EVs' only major flaw is that they're too expensive. So apparently the solution is to... make cheap EVs more expensive?

EU consumers like paying more, I guess. Not my problem ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Comment by Teamore: So much for being so environmental lol
Large businesses can't compete and come to their favorite tactic of lobbying anti-consumer policies
Did any of EU voters actually voted for this or was it decided by a bunch of rich fucks for whom the price of a car is non issue in their life?
Comment by SlapThatAce: I guess they're hoping Renault will have some good EVs hahahaha ... Renault.... They're banking on Renault bahahahahaha 
Comment by giggy13: The more it goes, the more I believe the West is scared of Chinese tech.
Comment by JonathanFisk86: Can't be having competition.

Hilarious for the EU to have an issue with subsidies given the history of VW etc. To be fair, Germany weren't on board with this.
Comment by Quirky-Discount-3412: Back when I visited China not long ago, I noticed that the vast majority of taxis are Volkswagen vehicles. Now, if the EU imposes strict tariffs on Chinese vehicles, the Chinese could do the same to European vehicles. European brands like Volkswagen who have huge sales volume in China, could see a massive decline in sales with retaliatory tariffs. They’re shooting themselves on the foot.
Comment by WuKuba: Nice
Comment by Reasonable-Mine-2912: It’s inevitable. EU EV industry is under attack and have no idea how to handle. The tariffs would slow down the invasion of Chinese EV but won’t stop it. It is sad that the table has turned around. It used to be China relying on tariffs to protect its industries.
Comment by Disciplined_20-04-15: Great news for $TSLA as they planned ahead with established EU manufacturing facilities.
Comment by photo-manipulation: I think it has more to do with China being a major market for German cars, especially the well branded luxury models, which will face similar tariffs.
Comment by Eurothrift: Will fail. China own Hungary which is in the EU. Will come in through there.
Comment by CurtCarbain: German car makers are forced to produce in China while China planed to export their subsidized cars to Europe. Find the mistake.
Comment by spellbadgrammargood: chinese make cheap EV destroy competition and manufacturing in EU. EU becomes dependent on China. a lot of Chinese kiss-ass in this thread. yall might as well buy everything from alibaba if you want the lowest and cheapest cost

EU and US leading the free world and championing free market.
Comment by frogingly_similar: Isnt this a clear move against its citizens welfare? I want cheap Chinese electric car, quit playing with your tariffs.
Comment by TheOneAllFear: I have a question. This seems like a natural move since china is subsidising so much the industry and my question is why mercedes and bmw criticise this move? Is it because they belong to different sectors of the market? Bmw and mercedes being in the luxury segment while china is aiming the budget/cheap segment? Or is it partnerships where they build cars in china factories since they are already equiped for that and send them over to not repurpose the europe factories?
Comment by why_am_i_here_999: Having a Chinese electric car and letting them control everything over the car is never going to happen in US.  Only an idiot would buy them.
Comment by None: USA lapdogs.
Comment by James_Vowles: About time, Europe just letting Chinese EVs into their markets and making it impossible for their own manufacturers to compete. Same thing as the US.
Comment by spanishdictlover: Long Tesla
Comment by Kermez: EU member states are getting slaughtered by Brussels. No wonder not only technical development is lagging, but cultural influence is diminished.

 First, they were destroying local companies with all sorts of green initiatives, and now they'll lock the Chinese market and components. Good luck to German manufacturers that counted on batteries. But hey, Tesla can profit instead. Take one for the team EU, you are great in that one.

Idea of EU was to compete with US and USSR, now US is lightyears ahead and China is also moving ahead, with Brussels being self-indulged and missing that Africa is growing and EU is pushed aside, and that competitiveness is shrinking year after year.

Well, at least US folks can enjoy when visiting it.

Comment by brocolliwala: maybe reduce the profit margins, insane bonus to executives and high dividends to shareholders..then the prices will be at par with Chinese EV…but that aint happening..meanwhile lets use wooden straws instead of plastic ones to stop global warming 😎
Comment by Highborn_Hellest: Those fucks better put like 100% tarrif on it.

Chinese dogshit will flood the market otherwise.

Also since a lot of battery materials come out of / through China, guess who gets fukt.

I'd like to also mention here that EU had nice solar panel industry but Chinese cheap shit killed them off, and now ours is next to non-existent. Better hope those tarrifs won't backfire.

Not like protectionist policies should have started 10 years ago.... Or 15
Comment by Realistic_Tale2024: YUROP BAD, CHINA GOOD.
Comment by Straight_Turnip7056: Strom in a cup.  No mention of how high the tariff actually is. 2%, 20%, 200%?  Relax. Nothing to see here. 


EU car markers never stood a chance in China anyway. Just test drive a BYD, and you'll see what I mean. It costs ⅓ of a BMW/ Merc in the comparable segment, and performs better.
Comment by InquisitorCOC: German luxury cars are still doing ok in China 

Their mass market car sales are collapsing in China
Comment by Echo-Possible: The German autos already manufacture massive quantities of cars in China to avoid Chinese import tariffs. China imposing even larger import tariffs doesn't really impact their sales because they've already located their manufacturing in China.
Comment by TaylorTWBrown: European auto workers, presumably.
Comment by ukayukay69: European automakers don’t want the tariffs but the EU leaders are imposing it because they are capitulating to the US government’s pressure for its allies to go along with its sanctions and tariffs.

Comment by ProfitLivid4864: Non-German auto makers
Comment by anakon4: I assume they are doing it to protect EU car production.  
Importing Chinese EV would completely decimate German production for example.
Comment by bool_sheet: Missed step 2.5: Give subsidies to their own car manufacturers for EVs.
Comment by ric2b: > EU consumers like paying more, I guess. Not my problem ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

I certainly don't, and it is my problem.

This whole thing is ridiculous, Chinese people apparently want to subsidize my EV and I'm supposed to be mad at that? The EU should be taking advantage of this, not slowing it down.

And if European car makers can't compete on the world stage they're screwed anyway, these tariffs will only turn them into zombie companies, it won't save them.
Comment by smd1815: The whole point of the push to EVs is not to reduce ownership of personal ICE cars but to completely reduce personal car ownership overall. This doesn't work if EVs aren't prohibitively expensive, hence clamping down on cheaper Chinese models.
Comment by wingsoflight2003: Chinese EVs are heavily subsidized and given 0 tax rate
Comment by Better-Literature-93: No that’s not why they impose tariff. China EVs are heavily subsided by CCP and hence company popping like xiaomi etc.. entering the industry. 

This is against the rule of free trade and distort the market when products are heavily subsided and therefore able to sell lower than the market price outpricing the local market and distorting the market.
Comment by Javimoran: I dont see where the contradiction is.

Step 1: Proclaim an EV future

Step 2: Don't let your local industry be pushed out of this future

Step 3: Eventual self sustainability (?)

It is not as if the EU is the first governmental body protecting its economy.

Edit: wow, is this the army of people owning chinese EV stocks in full force or what? I dont get how this statement is controversial.

The cheapest Volvo is also electric.

Citroen eC3 is built in France with parts sourced from 50km radius from the factoty.

Germany is just pissed off because Italy and France already have small electric cars on the market.

Meanwhile BMW and Mercedes are really struggling to sell more because guess what the number of ultra-rich people is limited.

Some finally figured out that average european can spend at best around 20-25k on a car.
Comment by TheFamousHesham: Did you not read the part where the EU automakers slammed the EU for their decision to introduce tariffs?

You know the EU has gone insane when it is choosing to ignore the interests of businesses and the interests of consumers.
Comment by ric2b: Renault actually has some decent models, such as the Megane EV. Stellantis is the one that is truly fumbling.
Comment by yyytobyyy: Renault had already electric trucks on the road when Tesla was just advertising Semi.
Comment by heraklaitos: Renault 5 EV is pretty lit
Comment by Javimoran: Tbf Renault has been doing EVs since over a decade ago. Just really weird ones.
Comment by Gab71no: BINGO
Comment by OG_Time_To_Kill: In fact, the Western countries have been strong for innovation and Mainland China has been the world factory for very long time ... once the technology immigrated into Mainland China = they can be copied very fast at a much lower cost ...

This was okay in the past (at least for three to four decades) ...
Comment by notreallydeep: Germany would've been on board if German automakers weren't afraid due to their huge China reliance.
Comment by tooltalk01: >Can't be having competition. ...

Imagine, China could have avoided all this if they hadn't shadow-banned all foreign EV battery competitors from competing in China's local EV market and forced all EV OEMs to switch to local EV battery makers to monopolize the battery supply-chain.
Comment by Clean_Flower4676: Attack, invasion… you’re brainwashed buddy.
Comment by snitt: Why is that? The EU would say that there is no fair playing field. Chinese car makes get direct grants, cheap land, tax reductions, preferential lending,... I don't think we need to be too naive here.
Comment by lo1ki: Mercedes and BMWs are luxury brands and they sell well or have sold well in China. China will impose a tax on foreign car brands in China as a revenge. Mercedes and BMWs get more expensive in China and will sell worse, so they will lose money in the large scheme.
Comment by Jalal_Adhiri: They sell a lot of cars in China they are afraid that there will be retaliatory regulations from the chinese government which will damage their sales...
Comment by Antique_Repair_1644: Maybe they're concerned that if the EU puts tariffs on chinese cars, China retaliates and puts tariffs on european cars.
European auto-makers, especially german ones are immensly dependent on the chinese market and they are probably scared of losing access. 
Comment by Antique_Repair_1644: What green initiatives have destroyed local companies? 
If I remember right e.g. in Germany the government let the chinese take over the battery and solar industry and instead of innovating, most of the german auto-makers invested their money in fossil-fuel cars.
The same goes for the telecommunication and semiconductor industry, steel and metal, and especially the pharmaceutical industry.
It obvious that china takes over the industries europe has dominated once, by just going with the time and actually innovating.
Therefore it wasn't green initiatives that destroyed europe, but conservative politics and arrogant managers.
Comment by Gab71no: You are exactly right: operating margins in China are single digit best scenario: just look at BYD in 2023 AOI was just slightly above 5%
Comment by hiiamkay: Welcome to free market. EU is fucked no matter what, even with the tariff using a vague and propagandist reasoning, good products stay alive, shit products die even with protectionist policy.
Comment by Sux499: It isn't mentioned because every brand gets a different tariff based on how much state subsidy they receive. Goes from 30%-100%.
Comment by Hayha2: It will be around 45%.
Comment by nasa_gov: Last week Li Auto for the first time surpassed the BBA (Benz, Bmw, Audi) in sales numbers in China. It was the first time in history that a Chinese Premium carmaker sold more than each of the 3 German giants.
Comment by dreggers: Ok for now because Audi used to be the de facto brand for CCP leadership. But that is quickly changing as China produces their own luxury models
Comment by wearahat03: There is no rulebook for China to go 1:1.

China's played unequal retaliation numerous times in the past. An example is when South Korea deployed THAAD missiles, SK motor vehicle sales in China dropped off a cliff. So, if China thinks Germany needs a 'lesson' they can boycott German MV without formally announcing anything. Then deny they are doing it.
Comment by justwalk1234: If only there is a way to find out what the automakers think of this tariff 🤷‍♂️
Comment by M1SCH1EF: Or they're trying to protect ev production in the EU. If ev's are the future, eu automakers will need help if they want to compete against Chinese automakers with lower labor costs and government subsidies. The best way to do it IMO is with subsides but most people are against 'handouts' to companies. And to address auto makers being against this, it's their duty as public companies to maximize shareholder return even if it's at the expense of their viability long term. Is this good for the average consumer or reducing carbon emissions? Probably not, but it's a complicated problem. I'm glad I'm not the one who has to make the call.
Comment by PlanetZooSave: Europe already exports significantly more cars to the US than they import from them. Plus labor costs are higher in the US, so they probably wouldn't be able to undercut European manufacturers as much as China can.
Comment by Straight_Turnip7056: Absolutely, and the touted "energy transition" !!  What's next, Exxon Mobil gas stations all over Europe?
Comment by notreallydeep: Meanwhile EU automakers are the ones against these tariffs (which is why Germany was one of the few countries that opposed).

Edit: who downvotes dry facts 💀 I cant with reddit man
Comment by FarrisAT: German automakers produce half their revenue in China. I guess they’ll just go bankrupt then.
Comment by justwalk1234: I feel that if this is meant to be the case, they really should ask the EU automakers to see if this is what they want or need...
Comment by kiff78: But there's so many car brands, just compete on quality/ luxury? Just like how German brands compete in the US
Comment by Echo-Possible: Globalism is good for the consumer in the short term but bad in the long term since all the jobs and expertise get outsourced. The EU will end up with no skilled workers and no jobs. Not good. 

China does the same thing by the way. China has import tariffs on foreign made autos as well. That's why all the European auto makers already produce their Chinese sold vehicles in China.
Comment by Gab71no: Agree, you don’t fix EU delay imposing duties

R
Comment by notreallydeep: I can make the same meme for EU countries making it very hard for ridesharing businesses 😄
Comment by Gab71no: That’s just an excuse asEU government didn’t do anything to push EV industry. Similar as per solar. EU is dead. US will follow
Comment by sicklyslick: Does the EU have a heavy tariff on subsidized companies like Tesla?
Comment by giggy13: subsidies are not a Chinese thing, the West does it too.

Comment by AlimonyJew: Do you mean to say, the EU does not give preferential treatment to their companies?
Comment by Gab71no: Why blaming China? Why not doing the same? It’s childish complayining for having being immobilized for decades. I am tired of the story we are the good guys and the others play unfairly. Reality is we lost competitive advantage and we are not admitting,ii
Comment by ric2b: Then explain why Tesla isn't being similarly hit with high tariffs.
Comment by Goo_Eyes: Why are the EU so concerned about Chinese government spending money that will reduce prices for EU consumers just to save a small number of manufacturing jobs.

"let's punish EU consumers to save a few thousand jobs" is what this is. Scumbags.
Comment by TheOneAllFear: Ooooh i see. Thanks
Comment by TheOneAllFear: Oh i see.
Comment by TheOneAllFear: Yeah, people replied with that, the german manufacturers do sell a lot there i forgot about that aspect. Thanks!
Comment by Kermez: Lol, just one example and there are numerous, just media doesn't like to write nice articles not to upset wondering why manufacturing is leaving EU:

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimvinoski/2024/02/29/german-deindustrialization-is-a-wake-up-call-for-us-manufacturers/

Let me not go into chemistry bans only in EU, that China and US are laughing at.

That is a rabbit hole that anyone working in industry knows of.
Comment by Actual-Ad-7209: > Welcome to free market. 

There is no free market when China subsidizes their cars to be sold below production cost and supports their companies with slave labor through the whole supply chain.
Comment by anakon4: Thats not exactly true.  
In a moment when Chinese EV will cost you due to import costs same or more than European one then its a no go.
Comment by zzhuang: Your view is outdated by at least 15 years
Comment by Echo-Possible: My point is all countries already impose tariffs on auto imports so that auto manufactures locate their manufacturing locally.
Comment by borkthegee: Automakers and auto workers are very different groups with very different opinions.

Automakers are against tariffs because their companies are struggling and retaliation from China will hurt their wealth and status and power. 

Workers are for tariffs because if artificially cheapened Chinese imports gain traction in their countries, they will all lose their jobs.
Comment by Sux499: We have those. They're called Esso.
Comment by ShadowLiberal: Yeah, a lot of people don't realize just how heavily dependent a lot of automakers are on China for a lot of their sales and profits. VW for example is already struggling because of how many of their Chinese sales have disappeared, and this is only going to make that problem worse, especially if China slaps retaliatory tariffs on them.

The automakers who haven't been shifting to EV's fast enough in China have especially been struggling in recent years. One of the big problems in the China automarket for many foreign automakers is that in the past even the Chinese viewed Chinese made automobiles as being low quality and preferred foreign auto makers. But now that they've improved a ton, and can make much cheaper EV's at the same time, the foreign automakers have lost their biggest selling point.
Comment by anakon4: Why?  
Because of their sales in China?
Comment by SMCudmm: They did ask and then proceeded to ignore them.
Comment by ric2b: > The EU will end up with no skilled workers and no jobs. Not good. 

It will happen with the tariffs as well. You don't solve lack of competitiveness by shielding companies from competition, you have to invest.

> China does the same thing by the way.

And it's also bad for them.
Comment by fear_raizer: Chinese EVs make Tesla shit it's pants when it comes to price to performance.
Comment by Better-Literature-93: EU imposed 7% tariff on Tesla EV that is made in China.

Between Tesla is not subsided by US.
Comment by tooltalk01: Sure, Made-In-China Tesla's are also affected by the tariff, though it's lower than others because the company doesn't depend on subsidized supply-chain as much as others.

Tesla's MY/M3 Long Range trims, for instance, use LG's NCM811, once practically banned in China with no subsidies since 2015.
Comment by tooltalk01: And not all subsidies are the same.  As the EU's finding clearly indicates\[1\]:

>(111) Not all subsidies are countervailable under the SCM Agreement, and the present investigation is limited to subsidies provided in China for the benefit of exporting producers of the product concerned.

Comment by Better-Literature-93: Both are subsidies but not the same exactly. U can google it. 

China wants to do dumping (flood the market with cheap good until local producer goes out of the market) 

US is not.
Comment by Javimoran: Yeah, how dare they believe that companies that represent integer percentages of their GDP and that have dominated entire markets cannot turn around and compete?
Comment by tooltalk01: >the EU does not give preferential treatment to their companies?

Sure, if they hand out preferential subsidies based on local vs foreign, it would be in violation of the WTO SCM Agreement, Article 3.1(b)\[1\].

The EU's countervailing duty is however based on China's violation of 3.1(a), aka "export subsidies," though China also violated 3.1(b) since 2015 \[2\] -- favoring local battery producers over foreign by in effect denying foreign battery competitors access to local EV market/subsidies and forcing all EV OEMs to switch to local battery suppliers.

Comment by Gab71no: Exactly, all countries do that, but if not western country it is unfair
Comment by snitt: The EU countries are open, democratic, well (overly) regulated economies. All subsidies are documented and public information.

Edit: instead of just downvoting, could someone enlighten me in what way there is a fair playing field? EU car companies can't even do business in China before creating a joint venture with a Chinese company.
Comment by tooltalk01: >Why blaming China? Why not doing the same?

The US and EU are actually "emulating" China's successful NEV policies: by protecting their markets from China and requiring local sourcing/production, as China has done since 2015.  Biden's IRA passed in 2022 is one; as is France's recent NEV policies updated last year is another.  The EU just approved the CVDs, but Turkey already raised their import duties on Chinese EVs twice. 

China just needs to learn to compete and collaborate with others.
Comment by tooltalk01: Tesla's Chinese operation doesn't heavily rely on subsidized supply-chain in China; not as much as others EV OEMs do.

For instance, Tesla's MY/3 Long Range always used LG's NCM811 since its first release in the late 2020.  LG is a South Korean battery maker and also Tesla's key battery supplier.  Under China's MIIT's “Regulation on the Standards of the Automotive Power Battery Industry,” foreign EV battery competitors were effectively barred access to China's local market/subsidies since 2015 to protect local battery makers.  Some of this was relaxed after 2020, but, in LG's case they received no subsidies as of 2022.
Comment by tooltalk01: China is subsidizing their EVs not because they like the European consumers or hate climate change, but because they want to prop up their local industry big enough to destroy the European competition and dominate the global EV industry.
Comment by hiiamkay: This has been thrown around a lot this past year and it's not true you know that right? Also you don't really make a point when calling them slave labor racist pos.
Comment by Highborn_Hellest: You know what's up.
Lots of Chinese industries work with massive subsidies
Comment by _Discombobulate_: Wait until you find out about Tesla lol
Comment by ric2b: Where is the evidence of all this slave labor in China?
Comment by hiiamkay: I mean yea that's fine you know? Let the market dictate that, I'm a consumer do you think I give a shit where my stuff is from other than the quality and price?
Comment by rapid_dominance: Which is a dumb take by the workers if they don’t realize they also lose their jobs if their employers TAM decreases
Comment by Echo-Possible: Any evidence that they are heavily dependent on China for a lot of their profits? Which autos break out profits by country/region? I would wager that profit margins in China are very low due to intense competition from Chinese autos subsidized by their government.
Comment by JonathanFisk86: Partially, yes, and their dependence on Chinese for their supply chains
Comment by notreallydeep: Pretty much, yes. Fear of a trade war. Something that would *actually* decimate German production considering its reliance on China. Even the labor unions are against it. When labor unions agree with corporations you know you fucked up.

Comment by Hans0000: Same companies that were already in a leading position prior to 2010s only to get absolutely rolled over once China started domestic auto manufacturing ?

European auto companies can only thrive when there is no competition, so much for ingenuity and innovation.
Comment by tooltalk01: No, not all countries do that.  There are really two very narrow specific prohibitions against subsidies and China has very explicitly exploited those to gain market domination as explained in my previous comment.
Comment by AlimonyJew: I’ll remind you that Apple has acquired a piece of land in Munich at a hefty premium and a pledge of significant further investment after many negotiations with the government. No German company would have to jump hoops the same way.

AI would not be as heavily regulated by the EU if Europe was spearheading the advancements.

Let’s not be naive and think that China is the only country looking out for its national economy by imposing restrictions on other countries.

Spare me the bs on democracy.

Ok, but Tesla in general does.

Comment by Actual-Ad-7209: You should tell that to the [Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods-print?items_per_page=10&combine=china):

There are reports that adults in China are forced to produce aluminum used in manufactured goods. Reports indicate that Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and other Muslim minorities from the XUAR are frequently subjected to forced labor in China through state-sponsored labor transfer programs. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) is a government paramilitary organization in Xinjiang that runs labor transfer programs and owns aluminum companies. There is evidence that both XPCC and non-XPCC aluminum producers in Xinjiang have received hundreds of members of persecuted groups through labor transfer programs.

Comment by Echo-Possible: The cars they build in Europe are sold in Europe. Most of the cars German autos sell in China are made in China. BMW makes something like 700k cars a year in China for example. So the EU workers won't lose their jobs because the Chinese auto sales are irrelevant to domestic EU market and manufacturing.
Comment by Ok-Employee-1727: It's surprisingly not a dumb take. Research showed that the tarrfis imposed by Trump (and kept by Biden) worked in a sense that they increased manifactoring jobs in the US and lowered profits only slightly.


Not what I would've guessed either, but FT wrote it this week. 
Comment by tooltalk01: No.  The EU's tariff only affect EVs made in China, regardless of brand -- VW, BMW, MB, Tesla, etc..

[How many Chinese cars have you seen sold in Europe?](https://www.best-selling-cars.com/europe/2023-full-year-europe-top-50-best-selling-car-models/) What the actual fuck are you talking about?

Comment by snitt: Al lot of whataboutism.

* German bureaucracy isn't pleasant for anyone, but even [china daily](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202112/03/WS61a94b46a310cdd39bc79046_10.html) sees Germany as the 2nd most open economy in the world. On the [economic freedom index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_by_economic_freedom) germany also doesn't score that bad.
* EU is overly regulating everyone. EU-AI startups often move to the US to avoid EU regulations.
* On any metric of economic freedom / openness, European countries score way higher than China. Chinese car companies can open a factory (without a joint venture with a European company) in Europe and avoid paying the tariff.
Comment by tooltalk01: Sure, I'd prefer that China follow the EU's approach, but anything is better than China's mercantilistic approach.
Comment by tooltalk01: Tesla's batteries mostly come from Panasonic and the company just dropped CATL's LFP in the US, which was used in low-end Standard Range/RWD models.  

LG's share of Tesla's battery supply which is primarily used in all Long Range trims in China/Europe is also not insignificant, which is why Tesla's tariff was reduced to 7.5%.
Comment by tooltalk01: The US doesn't give out subsidies based on export performance or promoting export.   The EU's antisubsidy probe only covers China's export subsidies as prohibitied under the WTO SCM Agreement, Article 3.1(a).
Comment by hiiamkay: And Ikea using prisoners or many other manufacturers are not forced labor? Why is Ikea not banished from EU then?
Comment by sicklyslick: How come american companies that gets subsidized by the US government not get tariffed? how about japanese?
Comment by Hans0000: I'm not talking about sales, I'm talking about technology. Chinese sales in europe are deliberately kneecapped by EU's protectionist laws such as these tariffs.
Comment by tooltalk01: Please see my WSJ quoted in other thread.   A long-time investor in the industry, so I have a bit more insight on China's NEV policies very anticompetitive and discriminatory.
Comment by AlimonyJew: You keep using the word openness, I don’t think it means what you think it means.

I’m sure you’d find China on many top 10 lists if you look beyond your bias.

And to say that one point makes a country better than another is just you trying to justify your opinion.

At the end of the day, each country is looking to maximize their GDP in any way possible, while trying to defame and shame other countries for following their own approaches.
Comment by Gab71no: Without China US are fucked
Comment by Gab71no: My wife boght an EV car in Italy this year having a government bonus of € 7.5 k. Isn’t that a government subsidy?
Comment by Actual-Ad-7209: Nice whataboutism, but at least you went from 'It's been proven wrong' to 'Actually someone else is doing it too'.

Ikea stopped all activity in Belarus years ago, they don't use prison labor anymore.

And yes, of course. Products of slave labor should not be imported, no matter who owns the company and if they don't stop they should be banned.
Comment by tooltalk01: China's Tesla's "export hub."

Tesla also exports Made-In-US EVs, but it's much smaller in quantity as the cost of manufacturing is much higher in the US. 

Japan's EV export # is tiny.
Comment by Gab71no: I have been working in automotive for 25 years and I saw EU government giving money to EU producers in many occasions. Examples Industria 4.0 just few years ago. Honestly, a part from formality, I can’t see the difference
Comment by tooltalk01: hate to chime in again, but China's transparency/openness, or lack thereof, is one key component of the EU's antisubsidy findings (2024/1866) that many overlook.   While all WTO members are required to report their subsidies annually, some don't comply because there is little or no cost for non-compliance.

That's also precisely what the EU Commission was really going after in their antisubsidy probe: the true extent and magnitude of China's NEV subsidies.  The Chinese gov't, of course, REFUSED to cooperate with the investigation and reveal that data -- the Commission's final countervailing duty is likewise largely divided between those who cooperated with the investigation (\~20% CVD) and those who did not (\~35% CVD)  +/- few individually sampled companies.
Comment by snitt: lets agree to disagree :) Doesn't seem like we will convince each other. I've lived quite a few years in Asia (China being one of them) as a kid. Without a doubt there is some bias on my side.
Comment by tooltalk01: Let's hope the West accelerates de-coupling, so Papa Xi can restore China's feudal imperial glory and stand on its own again.
Comment by tooltalk01: Sure, no problem. Good for her.   There is usually no problem with gov't subsidies unless your gov't does something like this\[1\]:

>... China requires auto makers to use batteries from one of its **approved suppliers** if they want to be cleared to **mass-produce electric cars** and plug-in hybrids and to **qualify for subsidies.** **These suppliers are all Chinese,** so such global leaders as South Korea’s LG Chem Ltd[ ](https://archive.li/o/REbZq/quotes.wsj.com/KR/XKRX/051910?mod=chiclets)and Japan’s Panasonic Corp. **are excluded**.  
... Foreign batteries aren’t officially banned in China, but auto executives say that **since 2016 they have been warned by government officials that they must use Chinese batteries in their China-built cars, or face repercussions.**  That has forced them to spend **millions of dollars to redesign** cars to work with **inferior Chinese batteries**, they say.  
... “We want to comply, and we have to comply,” said one executive with a foreign car maker. “**There’s no other option**.”

Comment by tooltalk01: In general, nobody really cares how your gov't pisses away taxpayers money locally; not our business.

But when subsidies are used as a tool to cripple foreign competition (even in local market) or promote/undercut export to other trading nations, it becomes "our problem."

Those practices are prohibted under the WTO's Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) Agreement.   And there are only two very narrow prohibitions -- China violated both, but in this particular case, it only covers "export subsidies."
Comment by hiiamkay: It is still wrong lmao, it says it has reason to believe, but no actual source/image? The whole point of this was to prove how EU, in the name of humanitarian and free market, always make up excuses to hypocrite their way through. Get some consequences for once.
Comment by tooltalk01: Honestly, not familiar with that particular project.  But in general no problem with subsidies to promote R&D, modernization/upgrade, etc, as long as they are not specifically targetting or promoting (a) export to undercut foreign competitors in markets abroad or (b) the use of local content over foreign.

In China, foreign competitors were denied access to their local market; and all EV OEMs were coerced to switch to local suppliers to get permit and subsidies.

Now even if we pretend that's what Italy did with Industria 4.0, the complianant must demonstrate that Italy's subsidy caused injury to local industry/interest to pursue an action against Italy.  So it's fairly difficult to bring an antisubsidy case against another country.   The EU fired the first warning shot against China's NEV regulation back in 2018 when it filed another WTO case (WT/DS549 -- still open), but had to wait another 5 years to bring the antisubsidy case against China as Chinese EVs flooded the EU market.
Title : Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter
Tesla posted its third-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report on Wednesday. The stock fell about 2% in premarket trading after the report.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q3 2024: 462,890

Total production Q3 2024: 469,796

Analysts were expecting deliveries of 463,310 in the period ending Sept. 30, according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount.

Deliveries are not defined in Tesla’s financial disclosures, but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. It’s one of the most closely-watched metrics on Wall Street.

In the year-ago period, Tesla reported 435,059 deliveries and production of 430,488 EVs. Last quarter, the company reported 443,956 deliveries, and production of 410,831 vehicles.

Tesla is facing increased competitive pressure, especially in China, from companies like BYD and Geely, along with a new generation of automakers, including Li Auto and Nio.

In the U.S., EV competitors like Rivian are maturing, while legacy automakers Ford and General Motors are selling more electric vehicles after walking back more ambitious goals for electrification.

GM this week reported a roughly 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter from a year earlier. Still, its electric business is tiny compared to Tesla’s, with just 32,100 units sold in the latest period, accounting for 4.9% of the company’s total sales.

Ford plans to report results on Wednesday.

Tesla hasn’t issued specific guidance for 2024 deliveries, but executives have said they expect a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last despite the company having added a new vehicle, the angular stainless steel Cybertruck, to their lineup.

The company also said on Wednesday that it deployed 6.9 GWh of energy storage products in the quarter.

Shares of Tesla climbed 32% in the third quarter, erasing their loss for the year in the process. The stock is now up almost 4% in 2024, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 19%.

Tesla’s brand has been under pressure in the U.S. due in part to the antics of CEO Elon Musk, who, in addition to endorsing former President Donald Trump, has shared what the White House called “racist hate,” and false claims about immigrants and election fraud on X, his social media app.

But Tesla still sells more battery electric vehicles in the U.S. than any other automaker, with Hyundai a distant second.

In its third-quarter earnings report later this month, investors will be particularly focused on profit margins.

Tesla has continued to offer attractive financing options and an array of incentives to drive sales volume in recent months in China as well as in the U.S. Prior to earnings, Tesla will host a marketing event on Oct. 10, and is expected to show off the design of “dedicated robotaxi.”

Musk has promised Tesla self-driving cars for years, but the company has yet to deliver. Meanwhile competitors like Waymo and Pony.ai have begun operating commercial robotaxi services.

Comment by k_ristovski: Total deliveries Q3 2024: 462,890 (vs. analyst expectations of 463,310).

That’s the real pumper
Comment by why_am_i_here_999: This company is a joke.  And nobody buys Trumpsla’s anymore.  The guy went full Mike Lindell and ruined the company.
Comment by jdrvero: Meanwhile Stellantis (Chrysler, jeep, ram) sold 305,294 for the quarter, down 20%.  Ford did ok with 504,039, a 0.7% increase, and GM did 659,601 total vehicles, down 2%.  When you look a Tesla, they only have 5 models to choose from, and somehow they sell about the same or more than the big 3.  The last two models tesla introduced are the model Y, which is now the world best selling car, and the cybertruck, which is now the best selling automobile over 100k in the USA.  Whatever the next model is will move the needle significantly and the stock will reflect that.
Comment by Notorious1MSP: Tesla is an enigma of sorts. Every year it's something else and it always seems to trade on the future of whatever's next, never the facts of the present day. It's a car company. An energy company. An autonomous driving company. Robotaxi. An AI company. Oh and they will have a robot soon... I'll give Elon that he's an absolute genius - not at inventing things, at hype. 

All of that said, if they pull of autonomous driving, robotaxi and the Optimus robot in the next 18 months, the shares are not undervalued. It's just that he rarely delivers on these lofty promises.
Comment by Substantial-Hold6273: 462k MAGA hats is a lot tho
Comment by sdkiko: I used to want one and now I refuse to buy one because of Musk, great job
Comment by RoaringJohnson: See this is why you never short TESLA,!
Comment by None: It’s already bouncing back. Since selling 460,000 teslas in 3 months is actually quite incredible, and that’s the most cars they sold ever in a Q3 of any year. Q4 sales are exploding now that the FED FINALLY dropped rates. This is that elusive ‘bargain’ price you always hear about. Buying when others are fearful!
Comment by ARAR1: Luckily the next scam is scheduled for next week....something something robo taxi
Comment by VermicelliFit7653: They'll make up for it in battery, charger, and solar sales.

Right?
Comment by InjuryIndependent287: 400k of those deliveries are to themselves.
Comment by FirefighterFeeling96: at this point i wouldn't be surprised if the robotaxi runs on gas
Comment by skilliard7: Why is a capital intensive car company trading at 70x earnings if they aren't growing?
Comment by TimeTravelingChris: And margins will continue to be lower vs 2023 Qs.

Tesla is on track to make about $2 EPS yearly with flat to no growth. Fair price would be about $30.
Comment by discreettravelai: It's also a worrying trend of overproduction.   They are delivering less vehicles than they're making by a relatively wide margin, which suggests softening demand and will eat into their profitability.  With an ageing design for most of the range and a failed new product launch (cybertruck), it's heading in the wrong direction just as more competitors join the EV market.

But will it matter?  He will come out and announce something ridiculous that they will never deliver and the stock will surge.
Comment by looknowtalklater: And that’s assuming the books aren’t already being cooked by Enron Musk.
Comment by StayPositive001: Honestly sounds like fraud, like it's all made up, but at this point nobody cares, to the point that subtle jokes like this can be made
Comment by RampantPrototyping: Mostly supported on the vague promises of robotaxis, FSD, and robots
Comment by Jayswag96: Bro it’s a tech company bro I swear FSD is ahead of the competition bro it’s gonna be in every car in 5 years bro
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: Luckily for Tesla theres still no domestic competition 

Teslas only worry is China, which again luckily for Tesla is also a worry for everyone.
Comment by ZeroWashu: They are not just a car company and they missed the estimate by less than 500 vehicles. Energy Storage is up from last years 4.0 GWh which is a sign of good growth.  We will have to wait for the deck to know how well they are truly doing. 
  
I am not worried about Elon's political issues as he is backing a losing candidate, I would prefer he stay out of US politics but he is as free as any of us to put his cards on the table.
Comment by kenypowa: Meanwhile every other automaker sells 10% of Tesla's EV number and Reddit is hailing it a gigantic success.
Comment by NadenOfficial: Tesla currently set a new record in Norway. In Norway new cars sales in September where 96,4% electric. Tesla had 30% of the market share of ALL cars sold here, 3 times as many as the next one on the list. A new record. Norway is a nice picture of how it will look like elsewhere when infrastructure catches up. Its probably going to be bump going forward but im sure the sales are gound to rocket next year.
Comment by Swamivik: Wait until they pull out their profit numbers at the end of the month.

The only reason their delivery aren't worse is because of their 0% financing.
Comment by Sanhen: To be fair, this wasn't a big miss. Overall, Tesla's future looks suspect, but not meaningfully more suspect than it did before the release of its Q3 deliveries, so whatever fears the market has about Tesla were mostly already priced in.
Comment by deten: They also barely missed deliveries bby about 500 cars.  Less than 0.1%.
Comment by FreshMistletoe: We cancelled our Tesla (would have been our second after selling our 2021 for more than we bought it for during Covid) right before we were about to pick it up because he was posting offensive nonsense on Twitter.  He just doesn’t understand who his buyers are.  I love the environment, being kind to people, etc., being associated with him via my car is a no-go.
Comment by BlooregardQKazoo: Who would have thought that vehicles designed to be as cheap to produce as possible would have QC issues?

I don't know how Tesla gets such a pass on things like not having an instrument panel or steering wheel stalks, for no reason other than to save them money on manufacturing. Call me crazy, but I'll pay an extra $500 if it means I can see my speed without looking to the side. 

Or no one talks about Elon literally telling people building the cars to use fewer bolts to save money. 

When I'm driving a multi-ton machine that can kill me and others at any moment, I don't like knowing that the CEO pinches pennies on construction of it, but apparently that makes me weird.
Comment by tatang2015: Just wait! Mellon the felon will be bringing that stick down like xitter!
Comment by dexvx: Values from Y! Finance. When you're trading 10x PE from other automakers you are under much more increased scrutiny.

Stellantis - 2.75 FWD PE  
Ford - 5.43 FWD PE  
GM - 4.59 FWD PE  
Toyota - 7.59 FWD PE  
Tesla - 87.72 FWD PE
Comment by greenpride32: What made Tesla "special" before was they were the only viable EV player in the market.  Once other entrants appeared, I think Musk tried to rebrand the company into something else.  But the problem this time is there are already AI players, solar players, autonomous driver players and robotics players.  They are back to square one which is being in the pool of one of many.  

Can we even say Tesla is a leader in any of these areas?  For a period of time we could say that for EV's, but everyone has caught up.  And Telsa once touted low cost EV's for everyone - another promise they have not kept - and the Chinese have already done it.  The reality is Telsa has no moat or IP giving them a competitive advantage.  Their most powerful advantage has been government handouts in the way of high import tariffs on competition and carbon credits.
Comment by PeteWenzel: People tell me it’s because of their BESS business, which is ridiculous.

It’s because people trust the hype.
Comment by mackinoncougars: Elon Cult
Comment by Mojojojo3030: But the age old question—will it matter?
Comment by PeteWenzel: Indeed. This stock is priced as if there was an obvious growth expectation. There is one for EVs more broadly. But Tesla in particular? I just don’t see it. Half of their sales this quarter were in China. Other markets will have to grow rapidly for Tesla to simply offset the decline they’ll suffer there over the coming years.
Comment by Luph: dont worry theyre going to announce their highly profitable robotaxi any day now
Comment by greenpride32: Its seems they play accounting tricks with their carbon credits.  The amount they report in a quarter has varied greatly and seems to be higher during tougher quarters.
Comment by SomberMerchant: Cultish idiots continue to pile into TSLA though
Comment by Ordinary_investor: Indeed, there has not been a grown up in charge in our society for quite a few years now
Comment by hoopaholik91: I just wonder if they ever get bent over by having to refund FSD money.
Comment by toonguy84: Aren't we supposed to be getting a robotaxi announcement from Tesla in October (after years and years of delay)?
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: No domestic competition? Ford and gm are ramping up their ev deliveries and even Rivian gained a toehold. Tesla went from no competition to an increasingly flooded market
Comment by wp381640: > Luckily for Tesla theres still no domestic competition

Ironically because Biden introduced the 100% tariff on Chinese EV's saving their ass.
Comment by pzerr: Chevy truck is a full frame truck. It costs less than the CT and gets far more range. It actually may be able to do truck things. 

I do not plan on getting it anytime soon. Too many variables in new EV. But it has far better specs at a lower price. Pont being, their flagship truck that helped this quarter is an extremely niche and gimmicky product. Their FSD on all their vehicles is only averaging 360 miles between critical intervention.  You need that around 1 million miles before you exceed that of humans. Much of their hype is based on gimicky features and that gets old. Eventually it comes down to profits and margins. And that is being squeezed hard.
Comment by Visinvictus: GM is making some serious Tesla killers right now. They are competing on price and the build quality and interior of these cars is leaps above Tesla. As they now have access to the Tesla supercharger network I don't see much of a compelling reason to buy a Tesla unless you are a hardcore fan. Equinox and Blazer are direct competitors to Model Y, Lyriq compares favorably to the Model X and Silverado EV blows the Cybertruck out of the water in almost every metric.
Comment by BlooregardQKazoo: Hyundai/Kia makes better EVs, and is building factories to qualify for federal tax credits. A year that passes where they build up and release a 3-row SUV while Tesla does nothing except release a meme truck is a good year for Hyundai/Kia
Comment by largespacemarine: Why would you say something so demonstrably untrue?
Comment by Ehralur: China is not competing with Tesla, they're competing with legacy OEMs. Tesla is like Apple at Android prices, China is Android at Android prices (only interesting for people who don't want a Tesla for whatever reason), legacy OEMs are Nokia/Blackberry; they'll all be bankrupt or reduced to max 1M deliveries per year in 5-10 years' time.
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: In less concerned with Elons political issues (from a business sense, personally I don’t like it), but rather with his lack of focus. He is the ceo of 3+ companies, and spends a lot of time publicly commenting on Twitter. Tesla is a major company that needs focused and strong leadership. The more than a car company is a good line, but is it one that can be supported empirically? Automotive sales are still the vast majority of their revenue
Comment by NYSurf117: Both candidates are pretty much tied and any lead one has over the other is within margin of error. And Trump typically is underrepresented in polling.
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: 2 things. One, other carmakers sell multiple of Tesla in total vehicles, the fact they are catching up on EVs is a huge problem for Tesla. And also look at any automaker valuation next to Tesla, you’ll see Tesla is valued for exponential future growth, so any sign of that not materializing is very bad
Comment by None: Look at valuations buddy. Thats the problem with Tesla
Comment by lkjasdfk: To be fair, that’s their claimed number. Read survey after survey that say that 90% of people with a college degree will never buy a Tesla. Never. Ever.
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: The issue is if major competitors with much stronger footholds in the U.S., like GM and Ford, catch up to Tesla as infrastructure is building out. Norway is a fairly small car market
Comment by Hacking_the_Gibson: Nobody can support a $1T valuation on the “we’re big in Norway” pitch.
Comment by Chemical-Idea-1294: In 2024 their market share is 20.8%, VW group is at 21.6%. Yes, Tesla has a solid market share, but it was 22.8% in 2023.
Comment by Top-Currency: Norway has the same population as Minnesota. It's really quite irrelevant.
Comment by n05h: Norway numbers are sometimes quite skewed because Tesla ships in large quantities at a time, so sometimes they peak quite high and dip for a while depending on the shipment timing. So I am not sure it is that representative.

You really have to look at Norway per year, it spikes too much on a quarterly basis.
Comment by FirefighterFeeling96: yeah they juiced the deliveries numbers as hard as they could and they still came up short, sad
Comment by abcNYC: Sounds like a good 2 DTE yolo opportunity on some OTM puts.
Comment by indicisivedivide: More than that Tesla has a very bad build quality. Can't have a good reputation when Rich Rebuilds mocks your engineering.
Comment by a_simple_spectre: Not everyday you hear about selling a car with profit lol
Comment by Itchy_Palpitation610: I mean, most cars you have to look down to see your speed. Still requires you to look away from the road so what’s the concern there?
Comment by jdrvero: Check with all those GM shareholders who got wiped out in the last recession and lost everything while the “new” GM took all the assets.  Most car companies are just government job programs.
Comment by GranPino: It doesnt matter, when you have a legion of fan boys willing to buy Tesla shares, the same way they bought DOGE. Reality doesn't matter at the short or medium term. But at the long term.... it will eventually crash hard
Comment by Prior_Industry: Have you factored in dancing robots replacing humans for live events? 24/7 Moulin Rouge!
Comment by Inconceivable76: It hasn’t until this point. 
Comment by renome: Yeah, I doubt it matters much for the next quarter. But as much as I wouldn't bet against Tesla's ferocious fanboys by shorting its stock, I wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole either.
Comment by pzerr: Eventually.
Comment by None: Hang on, Elon said you gotta price the company as an automation company or else you have no idea what you are doing. And he NEVER lies...

Honestly I've found Tesla to be overpriced for a long time. They took their eye off the ball which was making EVs more mass market, and they are loosing market share because of it. The robotaxi thing is still a pipe dream from what I've seen of FSD at the moment. So yeah...
Comment by callmecrude: The expectation is that battery storage keeps growing. 100% growth in a sector that has 50% margins makes pretty much everything else they’re doing irrelevant
Comment by TimeTravelingChris: Oh, I 100% think Elon is trying to buy Trump precisely because of accounting fraud.


I suspect we will learn a lot about Tesla over the next 1 to 2 years as their huge sales years get far enough back and we learn how warranty maintenance, and depreciation impact their finances with a mature fleet. Especially since leases are tracked as sales.
Comment by StayPositive001: Nobody with HW3/4 will ever get a robotaxi. And no Musk won't refund you, at worst he pays a fine orders of magnitude less than his gain.
Comment by Inconceivable76: With the latest judge ruling that musk’s statements were puffery, I’m guessing not. 
Comment by RampantPrototyping: Yeah but I'm skeptical its gonna be much different than the previous 5 years
Comment by hoopaholik91: There has only been two months of delay for the robotaxi.

Tesla tried to say for years that regular Teslas would become robotaxis and that there would be no need to build a unique vehicle for it.

But it seems like Elon pulled this out of his ass earlier this year to stem the stock crashing after Reuters reported they stopped plans to make a new, cheaper sedan from the ground up.
Comment by brumor69: Supposed to be on the 10th, but honestly hard to believe they’re anywhere close to it. They don’t even have first mover advantage anymore considering that companies like Waymo are starting to roll out.

(and yes, FSD’s promess is to be more flexible than Waymo since it could potentially go anywhere while Waymo is limited to a map of a city. But I believe Waymo’s strategy is enough to cover 95% of the robotaxi needs tbh)
Comment by BlooregardQKazoo: We were supposed to get one in August after years of delay. And then THAT was delayed. You should expect the October announcement to be delayed too.
Comment by Inconceivable76: Aspirational announcement. 
Comment by EnigmaSpore: It’s next week on 10/11. Invites already sent out and everything. No way it’s cancelled now. It’s at hollywood studios though so expect robots to be guys on suits and be skeptical of everything
Comment by Surrma: Ford and GM hahahahahaha....hahahahahaha
Comment by bigwinw: There is competition but many customers won’t have confidence in Gen 1 EVs from Ford or GM.  I bought a Tesla Dec 2023 because they are the safe choice when it comes to quality. 

In 3-5 years once these companies have some runtime in their vehicles more people will have confidence in them.  But that will come quickly.

It doesn’t help Elon is a shit talker and has pissed off people on the left who are most likely to buy an EV.
Comment by SezitLykItiz: Ford and GM lmaoooo
Comment by trabajoderoger: Eh, still can't compare. Look at the roads. Like 9/10 EVs are still tesla cars.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: Saving legacy autos ass

If $15k China EVs came to the states and succeeded it would instantly murder all legacy autos EV divisions.

It would slowly eat away at Tesla until they weren’t profitable at all and cause huge struggle possibly bankruptcy 5+ years in.

Then once consumers fully moved away from ICE legacy auto would be completely gone.

It has nothing to with saving Tesla and everything to do with saving America
Comment by ChokePaul3: Ford and GM needed that far more than TSLA did
Comment by SPorterBridges: > Tesla killers

Oh god, he used the words.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: Subjective. Sales says other wise.

Let’s wait and see if GM has the balls to post their losses like Ford. Will it be a -100% margin as well?
Comment by mayorolivia: What people miss is other brands don’t have the Tesla cool factor. Same reason Apple won with the iPhone. The difference is Tesla is unable to use the cool factor to its financial advantage. The stock price is whacky.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: H/K is doing well, relative to everyone other than Tesla and China
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: Why would you say something dramatically vague with no proof to back up your claim?

The article is praising GM for not even selling 10% of what Tesla sold
Comment by Ehralur: He's been the CEO of at least 4 companies for almost 8 years now. I'd say Tesla and SpaceX have done quite a lot better than they would've with any other CEO despite his "lack of focus".
Comment by cdsfh: Get outta here with your common sense and understanding of the industry!
Comment by Ehralur: It's hardly a problem for Tesla that legacy OEMs are bankrupting themselves by selling EVs at a 30-50K loss per vehicle sold.
Comment by GLGarou: But like in the other thread, valuations no longer matter! /sarc
Comment by paucus62: Those surveys don't sound very serious... it's easy to say outrageous things when you have no stake in the decision. Once "Emily BLM ACAB TRAHR" graduates and is looking to buy a car, the real cost of ownership and operation numbers make a Tesla more attractive
Comment by Ehralur: If anything, people who can do basic maths are more likely to buy a Tesla since they're the cheapest cars to own in the world all costs considered. If anything, it's unintelligent people who only look at a sticker price and don't realise they could be saving thousands of dollars per year.
Comment by TimeDear517: Those are the same people that claim that Blackrock&Vanguard abuse financial power and buy politicians, and yet they have most of their portfolios in VUAAs and iShares.
Comment by kenypowa: 😂. 

All the Teslas you see driving on the road, must be faked.
Comment by NadenOfficial: Irrelevant ok, but all cars will be electric by 2040 anyway, you dont agree on that?
Comment by Mojojojo3030: Insightful, thank you
Comment by BubblyYak8315: This is absolutely no longer true and even when it was it was just fit and finish. Tesla is the most reliable EV you can buy when you care about just getting from point A to point B
Comment by Mt_Koltz: The downside is inflation. Yes the number of dollars you sold it for was higher, but sometimes you're breaking even at the end of the day because everything else (especially your next car) is more expensive.
Comment by BlooregardQKazoo: Most cars you can keep both your speed and the road in your field of view. You can't focus on both at once, but you can passively view the road while you focus down. 

Teslas make that much harder with the speed further down and well to the side.
Comment by dexvx: You do realize that a positive PE ratio means the company is making money, right?

GM TTM net income is $10.8B. TSLA TTM net income is $12.4B.

Interestingly, TSLA Q1/Q2 2024 carbon subsidy was $440M/$890M. So basically of the $12.4B in net income, about 1/3-1/2 is from direct government subsidies.
Comment by a_simple_spectre: Yeah but they won't stay solvent forever
Comment by Mojojojo3030: How long?
Comment by justswallowhard: So based on ur login only fanboys are hodl the stock, no institutions and big money?
Comment by a_simple_spectre: Remember when FSD arrived in 2016 ?
Comment by greenpride32: FSD is a driving aid at L2 of autonomy - it is not robo at all.  Waymo and Cruise both offer true robotaxis today at true autonomous L4.  

If the robotaxi event is to tout FSD L2 the game is over.  My expectation is there will be some new tech unveiled.  But it's literally years behind Alphabet as Waymo has already been operating for several years.
Comment by sketch24: It doesn't help that people are attacking robo taxis. Doesn't matter if you make fsd if people won't tolerate it because it replaces them
Comment by Echo-Possible: Battery storage will be a race to the bottom on profitability. There's no technological moat and the massive battery cell manufacturers are already winning the biggest contracts in the world (CATL, Samsung, BYD, LG, etc). And Tesla will be reliant on their competitors like CATL to grow their production so they'll just get undercut by the people who control the battery cell supply.

Static battery storage will be commoditized at maturity. There might be decent margins early on as capacity is lagging demand but companies will ramp up to meet that demand and Tesla has a very small minority of total storage sales so profit margins will erode and trend to single digits as everyone cuts prices to keep market share.
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: But it’s such an incredibly small portion of their revenue. Even if it maintained such high margins, which is optimistic, the battery business would need to grow by multiples to move the needle for the overall company
Comment by PeteWenzel: Why does it have 50% margins? What is Tesla bringing to the table here? They buy the cells, do some software, design, marketing and servicing and that’s it. Can’t anyone do that?
Comment by hoopaholik91: Huh, interesting. Although I think a big factor is that it was brought by shareholders. A lawsuit from consumers that say they aren't getting what they paid for may be more successful.
Comment by xjay2kayx: Pretty sure Elon has been promising FSD since ~2016 and Robotaxis since ~2019.
Comment by sarhoshamiral: FSD promises a lot but reality has been different. In my mind if they were so sure of FSD, they would have at least gotten L3 permissions in some states, in limited conditions just for bragging rights and testing liability issues.

Waymo has been doing actual driverless driving for a while now and I do agree with you their method works. We don't need robotaxis outside of major cities now. Also maps are needed in both cases, FSD can't also navigate without an accurate map but it is true that it doesn't need a high fidelity map like Waymo. ie without a map FSD will also not now it shouldn't take a turn when the road dead ends with U turn that's hard to make.

However that's a scale issue really. If Waymo wants to expand to an area, mapping it wouldn't be a big hassle.
Comment by chsiao999: They haven't even begun applying for actual FSD testing licenses on US roads without drivers yet. It's all smoke.
Comment by LewisTraveller: Not sure if you can laugh about it. The EV delivery from both companies are going up. 

Not to mention Hyundai/Kia, Volvo, Rivian, VW, and even Toyota with their PHEV. 

Tesla will continue to be the largest EV seller for this decade. However, they will just lose market share to the late starters.
Comment by Trademinatrix: Get a clue, man. They are catching up. IDK why you think Tesla's position can't be unrivaled. Look at the numbers and see if you can laugh at that.
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: Two car companies that sell many times more cars than Tesla, and are slowly catching up on ev market share… so funny
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: What’s funny about two massive legacy auto makers with rising EV market share?
Comment by pzerr: GM has a full frame truck that gets far more range then the CT, hauls more, and has a lower price. The CT had a initial demand that helped this one quarter but we are seeing a flood of CT for sale already on the used market. 

Who do you think will lead in the truck market? Tesla with a unibody and odd configuration along with low range or GM with conventional frame, decent range at a lower price?
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: Right, but only a couple years ago it was 99% Tesla. The major competitors are starting to close the gap, and Tesla appears to be slowing down
Comment by sarhoshamiral: There are two things going on:

* PHEVs are more suitable for most people in rural areas so they are still not getting an EV. A few people I know got a PHEV instead of an EV waiting for charging network to get better (Washington has decent gaps in popular spots like Lake Chelan even for Teslas)

* In Seattle, when it used to be 9/10 Tesla for EVs it is more like 7/10 now. I see a lot more other EVs around especially newer cars. Ioniq 5 was fairly popular last year, Rivian and Ariya's seem to be the popular choices these days if I look at cars with temp plates.

The point is, Tesla now will grow with the EV market. Their first mover advantage is gone and Musk is doing significant damage to the brand. So that 7/10 will be 5/10 next year, 3/10 the year after and then 1/10 in 5 years if this trend continues.
Comment by TimeTravelingChris: In California, yes. Not true anywhere else in the US. Where I live Hyundai EVs are becoming very common.
Comment by RampantPrototyping: I would argue that creating a distinction between EVs and ICE creates a false dichotomy. Its rare that customers are 100% on either team EV or team ICE. EVs are competing against ICE cars and hybrids so its all the same market
Comment by None: I see a lot of Rivians now, no way Teslas are 90% any more. I don’t see 9 teslas for every other EV. I’d say it’s probably 50/50 now
Comment by Savings-Seat6211: Sure, but most of those chinese EVs look good aesthetically and provide serious value for the consumer. give them a few years in the US market and they'd take tesla's lunch too.
Comment by StagedC0mbustion: There is no cool factor with the way Elon has behave
Comment by Visinvictus: I test drove a Tesla, the interior was probably the least cool thing I have seen in any car ever. It looks and feels cheap and lame, like they have spent the last 5 years cost cutting. Elon has spent the last few years doing everything possible to alienate his main customer base as well.

I bought a Blazer EV earlier this year and it feels so much cooler than a Tesla. The one area that it's behind Tesla is on the software/operating system, I will admit GM is still playing a bit of catch-up there. Even that has been getting incrementally better through updates since I bought it. That being said, for the things that matter it works perfectly fine.
Comment by BlooregardQKazoo: Teslas advantages over H/K are solely software and charging network. H/K makes better EVs *right now*.
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: And I disagree. I think spacex has done quite well, but Tesla has lagged. Obviously the boring company didn’t do so well, and of course X is doing very poorly
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: Honestly the thing I notice most from a lot of comments I’m seeing is a lack of understanding about the future looking nature of the market. So many people have told me how ford/gm have only a fraction of the ev market share and don’t seem to realize that the current percentage is much less important than the direction. Competitors share is growing. Tesla share is flat or shrinking in many markets. That’s the story
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: You think gm and ford are bankrupting themselves? They are not
Comment by BlooregardQKazoo: Tesla is more attractive than ICE cars, but not more attractive than competing EVs.

Emily can buy an Ioniq 6 and get a better vehicle, period. And it'll be capable of charging at Superchargers soon.
Comment by BlooregardQKazoo: My Kia Niro cost less to buy than a Tesla, is cheaper to repair because the parts are easy to come by and it was designed for repairability, and because of that is cheaper to insure.

Tesla's problem is that they aren't the only EV in town now and they no longer get to claim EV advantages as Tesla advantages.
Comment by Angrybagel: Depreciation eats up a lot of the savings though. I'm actually not sure, it could wipe them out depending on how we compare. And if you want to look at lifetime costs I think a Honda or Toyota are likely to last way longer unless you're considering battery changes.
Comment by Itchy_Palpitation610: That’s fair but from my 5 years experience driving both a Y and a S you can quickly glance to see speed while keeping traffic in your periphery for the split second you glance it similar to any other standard vehicle. 

And I say this after turning in my rental car with a standard cluster that still required me to glance away at similar intervals and length of time.
Comment by Sanhen: It depends. Tesla might be overvalued relative to its financials, but it's also still turning a profit, so insolvency doesn't seem to be a serious risk at this time. Of course, that could change in the future.
Comment by Blackhawk149: Not when hybrid is going mainstream via Camry
Comment by GranPino: There are managers of institutional money that are cloud chasers and very naive people believing Tesla is going to build a trillion dollar business in IA, in robot taxis and in humanoid robots. So also Tesla fan boys
Comment by M0dsw0rkf0rfr33: I forgot about FSD arriving in 2016, I was too busy enjoying the Robotaxi and living off all that passive income it was able to generate!

My robot butler, that’s totally not controlled by a human off stage, and I are too busy stylin’, profilin’, limousine riding, jet flying, kiss-stealing, wheelin’ and dealin’ to care about FSD.
Comment by None: While I think FSD is quite flawed, saying it's years behind the competition is equally inaccurately. Tesla, for better or worse, is trying to design a system to handle every possible scenario right away, rather than trying to achieve the incremental levels along the way.

This makes evaluating it against waymo and others difficult. On the one hand, you can get more predictable behavior from waymo given that they can clearly state what it can and can't do. But a feature comparison is really difficult.
Comment by callmecrude: Profit is what matters here. 75% of Amazon’s profit comes from AWS despite it being 15% of their revenue. 

In Q1, Tesla made $1.13B profit and $0.5B of that came from energy and services, despite those divisions making up a tiny fraction of the revenue.
Comment by TimeTravelingChris: It's also easy to copy.
Comment by a_simple_spectre: Also gonna need a near-ish super conductor breakthrough

Either that or SUVs are about to get a new class
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: It's unwise to dismiss the value created in hardware and software integration.  Tesla's solutions are close to turnkey and are relatively simple to drop onto a site and connect.

In 2007-2008 there wasn't much special about iPhone either: commodity LCDs & battery packs, ARM cores that anyone could buy, some design, and a lot of marketing, but the sum ended up much greater than the parts and Apple's revenue growth reflected that.
Comment by callmecrude: People said the same thing about EVs. Ford, GM, and VW all claimed they’d surpass Tesla by 2025 in production. It’s now looking like all of them combined won’t be anywhere close. Manufacturing and logistics are a tough area to break into, where the first movers typically see massive success.

There’s a desperate need for energy storage and Tesla is the only game in town capable of scaling
Comment by hoopaholik91: Not as a separate vehicle. He wanted to turn customers' Teslas into robotaxis.
Comment by Surrma: Been an interesting couple days for TSLA...
Comment by the_doodman: More ICE cars. How are their EV ramps and margins going?
Comment by Ehralur: The fact that they're losing more money per EV sold than a Tesla costs in the first place. It would literally be more profitable (less unprofitable) for Ford to buy Teslas and sell them at a small loss than it is to sell their own EVs.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: GM put up a new record for EV sales this quarter and it’s still not even 10% of what Tesla did

If Tesla and China didn’t exist this would matter.
Comment by SezitLykItiz: "initial demand"

Oh wow, a talking point from 2017. Haven't seen that in a long time.


So if GM, an "American" company that makes oversized crome plated plastic disposible cars in Mexico and then sells it to misguided Americans who think they are being patriotic by buying "American made", actually made good cars, they would be able to sell a car or two in other markets where their Murica shtick doesn't work. Like Japan, or Europe, or rest of Asia. But nope, they can't. 

Not only do they not make good cars, they make dangerous cars. 200 Americans died due to the ignition issue which GM knew about for a decade but they didn't fix it. This isn't some 70s story, this happened in 2016 with the "new" GM. And then they fought the victims in court trying to weasel out of a settlement. Fuck GM.
Comment by cdsfh: Hertz has been offering more Kia EV6s and IONIQs lately as they’ve sold off their Teslas.

E: at least to me as a frequent car renter through Hertz
Comment by trabajoderoger: CA is a huge market. What state are you in?
Comment by hoopaholik91: Your intuition is actually right. Tesla has 49.7% market share as of Q2.
Comment by Kenneth_Pickett: Rivian has sold 70k cars in its history. Thats 15% of what Tesla sold this quarter.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: Subjective
Comment by Ehralur: Tesla went through production hell and managed to scale from ~100K sales a year to 2M over that period. They grew revenues faster after reaching $10B than any company in history. How is that lagging?

Also X is obviously doing great, seeing as Twitter was on course to be bankrupt by now and X is still going and rumoured to be close to running break-even.
Comment by cdsfh: >!I was joking, of course, I wish more posters were rational and understood how it all works!<

Agreed, and you can argue your fact based rationale in here, but most posters in here don’t care to understand.
Comment by the_doodman: Do you forget that companies need to actually make money to continue operations? None of that is relevant if ford and gm don't have viable paths to profitability selling EVs. And at this point, they don't.
Comment by the_doodman: ... Because they're clinging to ICE sales. Their EV business are hugely unprofitable and ramping slowly. No clear path to success there.
Comment by Ehralur: Yes, they are. They are clinging to ICE/Hybrid sales which will be largely gone in 5 years, yet they have no realistic path to making money on EVs.
Comment by Ehralur: Fair enough, the KIA Niro is pretty similar if not a bit cheaper in cost of ownership, but it's a rare exception.

Besides, the Niro is significantly less safe than the Model Y, has only 65% of the Y's cargo capacity, is much slower, has worse software, worse warranty, and I could keep going for a while, so it's not exactly a comparable car.

That said, it's definitely still a decent EV and a cheap one at that. The insurance isn't that much cheaper (at least where I live) though. Either way, I would easily pay the 6K extra to get a Tesla, but if you're only looking at price you make a good point. It's still the 0.1% of cars that as cheap or cheaper than Teslas though.
Comment by Ehralur: Not even close. Teslas had high depreciation between late 2021 and late 2023 because of the price drops, but the norm is that they have significantly lower price depreciation than ICE. Which makes sense, seeing as an EV can easily do 500K miles without any amount of serious maintenance, while an ICE car struggles to do over 250K miles and needs lots of maintenance to get there.
Comment by greenpride32: Stocks that trade at TSLA valution typically don't have flat growth, no moat, and declining margins.  It's simply not enough to just have a profit.  When you compare them to other megacaps, they stick out like a sore thumb.  Everyone else is fully established and one is just a bunch of what if's.
Comment by greenpride32: FSD is certified for level 2 of autonomy which means a driver with hands on the wheels is required at all times.  I do not consider this "robo".

Waymo is certified for level 4 of autonomy which means there is no driver in the car at all.  You can probably find YT videos for people who hailed rides.  This is considered "robo".

Tesla is clearly aiming for L4 or L5 for their robotaxi amibitions.  Waymo has been offering robotaxi rides for 7 years - how is Tesla then not years behind?

Telsa is relying soley on cameras, I assume because they don't want big ugly LIDAR sensors to ruin their image/look.  Problem with cameras is their vision can easily be obscured.  Do you have a backup camera on your car?  Ever had a drop of water from rain or puddles get on it?  Usually cleans off by itself very quickly but just that split second and it can cause an accident.  Water drop is just one example, what about direct sunlight, glare and shade?  

Waymo uses both LIDAR and camera, because they already know camera has limitations.  You have to remember here, Tesla can't just put any product on the shelf (or road) and sell it.  The product must meet safety regulations and receive a permit to operate as autonomous.
Comment by bartturner: FSD is where Google/Waymo was at 6 years ago.   Well kind of.

Because even 6 years ago Waymo was doing rider only and NOT requiring someone to sit in the driver seat.

So really more than 6 years.
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: Profit isn’t the whole picture. AWS could only succeed because of the massive retail side that carried the weight of the business. When their retail numbers struggle, the stock price struggles no matter how well AWS does, because AWS can’t carry the business yet. Same with Tesla. Tesla is valued at 3/4 of a trillion dollars currently. Obviously a half billion of profit cannot sustain that valuation. They are priced for tremendous growth, and any hurdle in that growth story is a real issue
Comment by Echo-Possible: Tesla has a very small percentage market share of BESS. CATL, BYD, Samsung, LG, SK have also developed turnkey solutions. They are beating Tesla out for some of the biggest new projects in the world. This will be a race to the bottom on profitability and commoditized product.
Comment by PeteWenzel: BESS isn’t a branded item. No one cares which company put together their solar modules. No one cares who made their BESS. Least of all utility companies who buy it for grid storage. They’re incredibly price sensitive.
Comment by PeteWenzel: BESS integration won’t be a high-margin business for long. It’s like solar modules. For consumers it’s a simple no-brand commodity item, where price matters above all else. And for large-scale grid storage where the customers are utilities or municipalities even more so.

Trying to justify 12 figure valuations based on that is ludicrous.
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: I don’t understand your comment. Both gm and ford are delivering more EVs. Not more than Tesla, more than they did last year. They are increasing their market share. This is very straightforward. Their ev margins are terrible. That’s not the danger to Tesla currently tho, margins improve with economies of scale and additional investment. F and gm trending up on ev delivery is an issue for Tesla
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: Tesla also started with negative margins, that’s how the build phase of the business goes. That’s what teslas advantage has been. But since EVs represent such a small part of the revenue of ford or gm, they can stomach the negative margins while they build up the ev business. Tesla is fully tied to their ev sales and margins currently. This is about competing with Tesla in their own space
Comment by None: [deleted]
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: The fact that a legacy automaker with a p/e of 5 is taking almost 10% market share from Tesla in EVs is a huge deal. Tesla, for comparison, has a p/e of almost 70 and sells far, far fewer total cars. Losing an market share of EV sales is a significant problem for them
Comment by pzerr: No one is saying Tesla is in trouble. But you stated it exactly. GM is putting up new records in sales. Tesla is declining. This would not matter except that 90% of Tesla's share value is based on Tesla maintaining massive growth.
Comment by StagedC0mbustion: Then buy calls 🤡
Comment by pzerr: LOL. The CT is not even allowed for sale in Europe because it is dangerous to pedestrians. It has sharp edges and lack of collapsible panels that is now expected to pass EU standards. GM trucks pass those safety standards and actually are allowed for sale there. 

So please to do not talk about safety when it comes to the CT in any way. Tesla does not even allow 3rd party crash testing and only does it 'own' testing. Ford, GM, Toyota.... all are third party tested and certified.
Comment by TimeTravelingChris: Not CA.
Comment by None: Yeah; that makes sense. I probably see more Rivians since I’m buying one, but I see tons of non Tesla EVs for sure
Comment by None: So? Im just saying I’m seeing more and more of them
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: They are lagging because they are ceding market share. They went from being the only game in town to having multiple rivals. 


X has allegedly lost 80% of its value since musk bought it. Advertisers have fled the platform. It’s delusional to say he’s been running it well
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: Dude I’m not sure what world you’re living in, but both ford and gm are profitable businesses. They are using that profit to launch their ev business which is new and obviously not profitable yet
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: Their ev businesses are a minuscule fraction of the larger businesses, which can easily prop them up as they scale and ramp. You make it sound as though these massive legacy automakers are dependent on their nascent ev businesses which is so far from the case
Comment by SoSeaOhPath: Yeah, the institutions are going to have to get realistic soon. With no growth there’s no reason for them to hold that stock. No amount of TSLA fanboys can hold up this $800 billion bag of hot shit
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: [https://www.ess-news.com/2024/08/26/global-energy-storage-cell-shipment-h1-2024-retrospect-and-prospect/](https://www.ess-news.com/2024/08/26/global-energy-storage-cell-shipment-h1-2024-retrospect-and-prospect/)

>The **global energy storage system shipment volume stood at 90 GWh in the first half of this year.**

>The **top five BESS integrators on the AC side** are **Tesla**, Sungrow, CRRC ZHUZHOU INSTITUTE, Fluence, and Envision, having shipped more than 30 GWh together.

>The **top five BESS integrators on the DC side** are **CATL**, BYD, HyperStrong, RelyEZ Energy, and Narada Power, which together shipped more than 20 GWh.

>In both categories, the top two manufacturers account for the lion’s share of shipments, leaving the rest far behind.

We know from Tesla's 10-Q filing for Q2 '24:

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828024032662/tsla-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828024032662/tsla-20240630.htm)

>In 2024, **we deployed 13.46 GWh of energy storage products through the second quarter.**

Tesla had just under 15% global market share total, and nearly half of the top 5 for AC systems.

So while it is accurate to say that their market share is small currently, Tesla is relatively larger than most of its competitors.

Note:

* Tesla's Megapack factory in Lathrop, California is not fully ramped (40 GWh/year expected full capacity)
* Tesla has a 2nd Megapack factory under construction in Shanghai, China.  Expected production capacity is at least 40 GWh/year.

>This will be a race to the bottom on profitability and commoditized product.

Time will tell.
Comment by bobskizzle: Unless you're in power systems engineering or a similar field, you're simply talking out of your ass.

Integration is *the* value-add for this kind of market. Nobody on the ownership side wants to put together an entire department of engineers to bring the system design, vendor selection, manufacturing supervision, field installation support, and maintenance in-house. Offering these solutions turnkey is how the entire facilities industry works. HUGE companies like Bechtel, Jacobs, CB&I, all do this same kind of thing in their specific area. Having the manufacturing part in-house is a HUGE moat.
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: Again, Tesla's energy solutions are close to turnkey and easy to deploy.  Branding isn't part of my argument for why Tesla's energy sales continue to grow rapidly.  

The SEC 10-Qs from 2023 reported that Tesla deployed 4 GWh of storage in Q3 '23, and today's press release reports that grew to 6.9 GWh in Q3 of this year.  That's 72.5% YoY growth.  Tesla is clearly creating value here for their customers.
Comment by callmecrude: It’s impossible to say what the long-term 20+ year outlook will be. But to compete in the space and build out a factory like Tesla’s megapack facility is a 5+ year commitment that no one else is currently biting at. Until there’s competition Tesla can charge whatever they want as they’re currently sitting on a 2+ year order backlog. 

I don’t own Tesla, I’m just pointing out the reality of why it’s priced the way it is. 99.99% of people in these threads don’t seem to understand the landscape of the power industry. They just know they don’t like Elon and look for reasons why the stock should be $10 instead of objectively valuing all pieces of the business. Tesla is currently on track for their energy and service division to be making more profit than the rest of the company combined by 2025, while growing at high double digits or low triple digits.
Comment by Ehralur: What are you talking about? Tesla only ever had 1 quarter of negative gross profit margins, Ford Model E is around -100%...

EDIT: Why is this getting downvoted? It's a simple statement of fact that anyone can Google:
https://x.com/alojoh/status/1826694840567931308

EDIT EDIT: Apologies, [Ford is actually at -200%, not -100%.](https://www.shacknews.com/article/140697/ford-f-model-e-ev-q2-2024-margins)
Comment by Ehralur: It's hilarious that you're trying to lecture me while not understanding that capex has nothing to do with gross margins but with operating margin.

[Tesla was never gross margin negative, except for a one-off outlier quarter.](https://x.com/alojoh/status/1826694840567931308) [Ford is hovering at -200%.](https://www.shacknews.com/article/140697/ford-f-model-e-ev-q2-2024-margins)

> To put it plainly: Ford & GM are not spending the amount of a Tesla on every vehicle on a unit basis.

To put it plainly: Yes they are. That's exactly what gross margins mean.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: Does GM also have the best worldwide charging network, or a large % of the global battery storage market, or the second most capable public self driving system, or profit margins on EVs, or….

Tesla is overpriced, but GM is too.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: Teslas GROWTH is declining. They are still growing overall 

Unlike GM, who peaked in 2017. They’ve just managed to trick idiots into paying more for the same junk.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: I’ve been DCA out of Tesla since like $260. Sure as shit wouldn’t buy GM tho
Comment by SezitLykItiz: Forget the CT. Talk about M3 and MY. Actually, forget Tesla, I dont want to even defend it. You're the one saying people-killing GM is so awesome. I never said anything about how good or bad CT is.

Talking about "GM safety standards" lmfao fuck GM.
Comment by trabajoderoger: Then no one can really confirm you're statement
Comment by Kenneth_Pickett: I dont even like Tesla but it was just a stupid comment. Theres 1% as many Rivians on the road as there are Teslas. The reason seeing a Rivian is so significant to you is because theyre so rare.

Also acting like having “only 50%” market share of a huge growing product is funny. Apple has been losing market share since 2012. What a suffering stock its been since /s
Comment by Ehralur: Every CEO or VC and their mothers have been praising Elon for getting rid of 80% of staff and still operating it more effectively and much more profitably (or less unprofitably) than before. They made more improvements to the product in the first year than Twitter did in the decade before. With 20% of the staff...

You're delusional.
Comment by AustinLurkerDude: I believe the concern is they (ICE companies) will run out of money or never reach profitability with their EVs. EVs like ICE can only be profitable at scale, you can't profit only making 10k cars/yr. Hence why Lucid, Rivian, etc. releasing much cheaper models, as they all use common SW/HW platforms or components. 

  
Billions in losses isn't surprising, Lucid and Rivian doing the same. Just question on burn rate, since the EVs are being supported concurrently with ICE cars.

  
BMW and Cadillac are aggressively pricing EVs at substantial reductions of MSRP to get them moving. Often with tax credits or really low interest rates just like Tesla. By the time the ICE companies actually get a profitable economy of scale they'll be fighting several EV only companies along with Asian (BYD/KIA, Hyundia) ones. 

  
The good news for ICE companies is there's still several decades of ICE car sales remaining so they do have time.
Comment by VermicelliFit7653: >Branding isn't part of my argument

Then why did you make the iPhone comparison?

Power storage is a commodity, period. Long-term it will come down to the cost of the batteries, and Tesla doesn't even have any real advantage in battery technologies.

>Tesla is clearly creating value here for their customers.

But not nearly enough to justify the valuation.
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: Their first full profitable year was in 2021…
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: How do you figure GM is overpriced??


What you point out is actually an issue I see for Tesla, they don’t have clear direction. Are they a battery storage company? What is their revenue, market share and growth plan for that business? Profit margins on EVs are not something to rest on, others will catch up just as they are catching up on deliveries, and they have far more diversified revenue from traditional vehicle sales to balance out losses as they catch up. Self driving… is a far ways away from being a money maker. Tesla has a lot of strengths. It also has a lot of challenges. The biggest one I see is exactly what I said in my first comment: lack of strong leadership to navigate the challenges and opportunities
Comment by largespacemarine: Everyone has the same charging network. And Tesla batteries are world renowned for using terrible chemistry, they are not insurable for utility scale sites for example.

They don't have a functioning self driving system, their margins are decreasing. You are simply a fanboy.
Comment by GranPino: Tesla has a 50% in some battery factories that actually Panasonic manages it. They can buy batteries to the competence., as the battery business is becoming increasingly saturated, with falling prices. It was a comeptitive advante earlier, right now, not so much.

The technology of Tesla for selfdriving isnt the best in the market. the difference is that they are the only one willing to let drivers to use unsafe technology. 

Right now, Tesla has lower margins than BYD, whose valuation is so much lower, although BYD has better margins, build more EV cars, has more additional business, and they are actually growing
Comment by pzerr: Actually no. They sold few cars than last year and their margins got way smaller. They are making about half the profit they did from last year. That is a significant decline in every metric. 

GM stock price is reasonable based on their profits and growth. Tesla stock price is based on 50% growth year after year. It took about a 50% decline this year in profit and 10% decline in manufacturing.

And their key product they say their value is based on, Self Driving? On average requires critical intervention every 360 miles. To be mainstream, it needs to extend that to about 1 million miles between critical intervention.
Comment by Didntlikedefaultname: Likewise lol
Comment by Magikarp_to_Gyarados: iPhones are excellent products independent of their branding.  They're generally reliable, have many years of software support, the user interface is consistent, and integrate well with cloud platforms, whether Apple's iCloud or something else.

People buy iPhones because they work well, not just because they're sold by Apple.

>But not nearly enough to justify the valuation.

While I agree with you, we are not the ones who set the valuation.  The markets set the valuation.  Whether the valuation is justified is a pointless question.

The only relevant question is whether you believe Tesla is or isn't likely to be worth more within your investment time horizon, and its potential relative to other investments under consideration.
Comment by Ehralur: Are you seriously frequenting a stocks subredddit without knowing the difference between gross profit margins and operating income...?
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: GM is shrinking but priced for growth. Historically it should be a lower pe.

Tesla is overpriced but at least it’s growing and successfully adding revenue streams.

GM is cannibalizing its ICE sales for EV sales which they are not profitable on. Only 50% of GMs ev customers were new, which means 50% didn’t buy a profitable ICE car but instead bought an unprofitable EV.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: Everyone has access, they pay for it while Tesla gets paid for it.

Everything outside of margins decreasing is subjective.

You don’t understand businesses.
Comment by carsonthecarsinogen: 430k

Is not a decline
Title : Rivian Stock , Buy ??? 
Hey everyone,

I’m considering whether or not to purchase Rivian (RIVN) stock, but I’m on the fence and would love to hear your thoughts. With Rivian’s stock dropping significantly since its IPO, I’m wondering if now might be a good time to buy in or if it’s too risky given their current challenges.

On one hand, Rivian has had some positive developments, like their partnership with Amazon to deliver electric vans and the growing interest in their R1T and R1S models. They’ve also recently secured a $5 billion deal with Volkswagen, which might help with cash flow and expansion efforts. Plus, some analysts are still giving the stock a “buy” rating, predicting a potential rebound to around $17-30 over the next year, which would be a solid return from its current price.

However, there are also a lot of red flags. The company has been burning through cash at a rapid rate, losing $1.45 billion in just one quarter this year. On top of that, they missed delivery targets last year, and competition in the EV space is fierce. Some forecasts suggest that Rivian’s stock could drop even further, to around $13 or lower by next year, or even as low as $4 by 2030 if things don’t improve.

For those who have already invested in Rivian, do you think the stock has the potential to bounce back? Or is it likely to continue struggling with production delays and competition? I’m especially interested in hearing from those who have followed the company closely—do you see any key indicators that might suggest a rebound, or is this a risky bet that could lead to bigger losses?

Would love to get your input before making a decision! Thanks!Comment by PunishedRichard: I would not buy Rivian unless I was trying to swing trade from something like $5 a share. I understand the product is good, but the cash burn is way too aggressive and the car industry is just very hard to succeed in. I would say the same thing about most other EV stocks. There are better opportunities for speculative investments in other sectors.
Comment by NixNax4: It was trading a $8.40 in April prior to the $1 billion dollar lifeline (up to a total of $5 billion) by VW for their joint venture. It is now trading at $11.17. This seems like a good entry point if you think the R2 will be a successful product. I picked up some shares the last few days but its still a gamble and you should treat it as such. There is no sensible reason to buy a Rivian with their low number of service centers, high repair costs, and high insurance costs... but damn, do they ever have a good looking product.
Comment by The-Jolly-Joker: Until they get the Georgia plant going, I'm staying away as far as possible. Output is too damn low for its valuation.
Comment by Alternative_Cash_925: So everyone saying no ha??? So I guess I’m in then
Comment by SnoozleDoppel: The way to profit from EV is not to buy Tesla or Rivian etc.. they have huge capital investments competition and have to take risks. The way to play is follow the classic picks and shovels strategy.. buy the supply chain players.. power semiconductors, lithium, copper, electrical connections, charging infrastructure, etc. electrification is a given... These companies will make money. 

Selling EV at loss that replaces ICE vehicles is not going to make you money as you are replacing one with another... Not necessarily increasing sales...
Comment by RunningForIt: Bought a small position earlier this year at $10.50 and sold after the Volkswagen news. Haven’t looked at it since then until now and saw it’s back around $11. 

Love the vehicle, company seems like headache though from everything I’ve seen/looked at myself. 

What are they doing to fix their burn rate. The money from Volkswagen is nice but that doesn’t solve their problem it just postpones it. Is there any evidence the cheaper Models will have higher margins? That’s their biggest issue. How do they fix it? Will fixing it make their product worse? Etc. Etc. 

I’m happy to root from the sidelines and am rooting for the company but their seems like way easier ways to make money.
Comment by Bobby-furnace: I live in a HCAOL and I’m seeing more and more Rivians. They look great and I think they might be able to take some Tesla business. I bought a couple hundred shares on that possibility alone. We will see.
Comment by dexvx: IMO, right now is too early. Even if they have a profitable gross-margin by Q4 (with the R1 Gen2), they'll still bleed about $1B/quarter, based on their past financials. And that's going to be a long 5-6 quarters until the R2 starts production. And then you run the risk of R2 sales not meeting expectations.
Comment by Coloradodreaming1: Just buy it.  High risk but high reward.  We all hold a few of these.  Buy it and look at it after R12 and R13 numbers come out 2026.  If it’s anything like the bump to profitability Tesla got look out.  They are very busy selling everything they make.  Look at the website store for what is available nationwide.  I think they only have a few 3 or 4 R1S trimotors in the store.  They are also busy building service centers and charging stations.  As these numbers grow and people live closer to service centers the sales numbers will continue to grow.  They have a unique product unlike anything on market now.  They have also retooled the factory and make motors in house etc. so the cost per vehicle is going down to make.  Lastly I own the stock and like it full disclosure.
Comment by callmecrude: Management doesn’t care about shareholders at all. Anyone objectively looking at the stock can see the ridiculously high cash burn rate, the shareholder dilution, and the ever increasing debt loads. They’ve missed virtually every metric they ever set and don’t even have their “performance” compensation tied to company performance.

Note that gross margin is still massively negative, meaning they’re selling their vehicles for less than the basic raw materials and labor to build the vehicles even cost- something Tesla and other EV makers never did. 

Imo wait until they show a clear path to profitability before buying. This is a company that has the potential to thrive; but in its current state the stock is just a piggy bank that the execs are using to increase their own wealth while they dilute and destroy shareholder value.
Comment by Lethal-injection98: They have a partnership with Amazon, there is currently more than 10,000 rivian trucks delivering for Amazon and more to come, they were partnered with Mercedes as well but rivian dropped that partnership themselves. Give this company 5 years and it’s gona dominate mark my words.
Comment by RoboticGreg: I think it's possible in the next 5-10 years as self driving tech advance car ownership could change. Too much potential for major market dynamics shift. True self driving on open roads could make the concept of owning a car change. If you can pull it an app and have ANY car you want for however long you want and get rid of it immediately after really changes how people relate to cars and makes it possible for them to be much more expensive. I'm not saying it will happen but it's very much a possibility so I'm staying away for now
Comment by dvdmovie1: "With Rivian’s stock dropping significantly since its IPO, "

People looking at the IPO price and how much it's down since - it should have never been at that price. They were lucky to go public at that valuation,  but shareholders who piled into that bubble got obliterated.

Looking forward, RIVN probably is one of the few smaller companies that went public in 2020/21 who will get through this period but I don't think that's ultimately as exciting as people think. Too many people still treating the EV theme like it's the 2020/21 bubble and trying to pick the next Tesla. Meanwhile, a number of 2020/21 EV ipo/spac names are already 0's - some of which are 0's for the second time. 

The automobile business - with a couple of exceptions - is not a great business (I mean, again: multiple EV companies that went public a few years ago already 0's) and Tesla made everyone think it is, despite Musk frequently going on about what a difficult business it is over the years.

So, can RIVN bounce? Sure. Is it going lower if there was a recession in the next couple years? Ab-so-lutely. Do I think it can be one of the few smaller names that ultimately gets through this period? Yes, but I think the market has gone back to the idea that automobiles are not a great business and people keep wanting them to be something they aren't.

So, I think RIVN could bounce on any good news, it's going to be a tough hold through whenever the next recession is and on the other side of that will probably do fine on the upturn but I think people still expect too much/"is it the next TSLA!?!?!" from the theme.
Comment by tnmoi: I was a huge Tesla fan until Elon started behaving like Trump (just a younger version) and possibly a more deadlier version with his Space X and Twitter companies to influence the world.

I have been marveling at the Rivian and am totally impress with the quality with the recent visit to their showroom.
Comment by HyrulianAvenger: Chart looks awful compared to its cohort
Comment by North_Concentrate280: What’s your take on polestar? Similar situation but stock has been red hot this month.
Comment by JPMorgansStache: The stock has lost -91% of its value since IPO. There is no foreseeable plan from them to even so much as regain half of what they lost, which makes the prospect of long holding their stock hard to imagine. Also, they are likely to fend off falling to 0 for quite some time but that doesn't mean even options trading would be lucrative.
Comment by None: They have a great product
Comment by stockpreacher: Go look at the automotive sector. Then, look at the macroeconomic indicators.
Comment by heatedhammer: I've been buying over the past week on the way down to $10.50 a share.

It's a high risk high reward play, if it pays off it won't be for at least a year or two.

I believe that EVs are the future and the ICE market is going to start contracting in the years to come. It's already started just not as quickly as it was 2 years ago. All car makers are planning their EV future, even if they won't admit it publicly.

Tesla proved a pure EV model works, others can emulate it and avoid having a CEO who insists on damaging their brand.
Comment by TimeTravelingChris: I get downvoted whenever I say this but I 100% believe they will have to issue a lot more shares to generate cash, despite the VW deal.


I also believe Apple should just buy them.

Comment by brothbike: Maybe checkout Polestar
Comment by InsaneGambler: You should look at the long term. It looks like the meme stocks. Hell, there's several subs talking about Rivian stock with talks about how shorts or Elon Musk are attacking the stock or whatever.
Comment by mogambuu: If atall, I will buy at 3-4 bucks when it becomes a potential takeover target. I wouldnt buy their vehicles as the company might not exist in another 3-4 years.
Comment by C130J_Darkstar: LEAPs are probably a good bet here
Comment by TwitchyTwitch5: My issue with rivian is that they admit they take a loss on every car sold.  I'd be leary of them long term.  I have doubtsthey will survive the next 3-5 years
Comment by Vast_Cricket: 99% of ipo tech stocks fall more than -35% after 2 months. Some even more after 6 months.  Until it can turn around showing it can be profitable, like every auto company including Ford. My entry point to buy F is at $9 and with Rivn I just hold enough shares to see if there are oppor6tunity to short it.  Likely to be bought out by foreginers to stay as a US company.

Comment by Zoidbergslicense: I’m waiting for that R3X.  I think it’s possible the coolest car of the decade (assuming it’s close to the prototype)
Comment by addsomeham: It's ok to be wrong ;)
Comment by SnoozleDoppel: I do not know much about Rivian.. but as an investor for you to make money they have to sell a lot more vehicles at profit while investing in massive factories and competing with other players

Instead I would bet on lithium miners like albamerle or sqm and other lithium lifecycle companies beyond miners. 

I heard battery might be commoditized .. so maybe battery recycling. 

Think what changes in the car architecture.. more motors more copper more high voltage electric lines and interconnects .. companies like molex amphenol comes to mind. 

Then semiconductors that focus on power conversions and controls like nxp infineon renesas will also win irrespective of who sells more EV. 

Then there are utility companies which should see more demand along with data centers. There is massive work in EV infrastructure and charging but again focus on the vendors and not necessarily blink or charge point. 

Along with ev.. there will be a shift to automation .. the players making the cameras lidar chips and software would make more profit than waymo Tesla or gm who are competing to bring the vehicles. 

It doesnt mean that Rivian or Tesla is a bad investment but it's no longer a first mover environment... I have no idea of knowing if they will or will not but if I trust that EV is going to be the future.. then I would bet on the supply chain. 

Solar might be a big winner in EV . Not so much in data center case. Think ancillary issues... Charging time is still a problem... Land is limited... You want chargers in strategic location. Who has land that might become useless with ev chargers.. think the gas stations... So they will transition there with scope of commercial real estate developing. Else the grid will transition to micro grid with battery storage becoming more critical.
Comment by ZeroWashu: I do not think they want to do what they need to do. Besides as being pointed out they cannot even produce the vehicles profitably and it is not that close they are spending this year based on their own production numbers nearly seventy thousand dollars per vehicle sold to run the place.   
  
To turn around they first need to be profitable on their product but even if, and this is a big if, to pay the four billion a year they spend to run the place requires selling more vehicles per quarter than they sell now per year and clearing twenty thousand plus on each. That is how deep this hole is.

Comment by TwitchyTwitch5: Honestly, for me, it's both.  For a company like VW, for example, to admit, they lose money on every bugatti veyron that rolled off the line. It's eh, because it's a niche car for a niche price that only %0.5 of the worlds population has the capital to afford.  So realistically, it isn't cutting into their bottom line as much as it sounds because VW still has audi and several other brands that are rebounding the loss from bugatti. But rivian is selling to the general public an EV that they claim is competitive to tesla, and announving that they are losing $32,000 per vehicle,  which granted,  from q4 23 losing 43k to now they're reducing that number sure, but that's still per car world wide. How long until you're making a profit, any profit in your vehicles.
Comment by Slaaneshdog: Scaringe is a likable guy, and Rivian is a cool company in many ways, but none of it matters in the long term unless they can fix their absurdly bad financials
Comment by RoboticGreg: In Connecticut there's a lot here, and the Teslas are losing road presence. You see a lot of gm evs, a lot of Ford, and a rising number of rivians
Comment by OkraOk6168: I see them everywhere here in MD/DC
Comment by ShadowLiberal: I don't live in a tech area. I've seen maybe 3 or 4 Rivians on the road in the last few years.

All the people I know who have an EV have Teslas, including several of my co-workers.
Comment by baccus83: I have driven a Model X, a Model Y, a Lyriq and a Ford Lightning (not an SUV I know).
Comment by CraigLake: That R3X looks amazing! Starting at 41k seems super reasonable as well.
Comment by bitterbeerfaces: Thank you! I appreciate the time you took to reply
Comment by WatercressCurious980: Any specific companies you like for stocks that are mining companies or what not you like? I agree with the idea of what you’re talking about.
Comment by None: And you like the rivian better than the Tesla Model y? I really like the Hummer EV.
Comment by SnoozleDoppel: I like Albemarle that is easy.. I think the rest are ok but these are capital intensive companies and many of them don't have great financials or are based in countries with lax rules or risk of nationalization. Also different companies have different price agreements. Lithiums main risk is technological developments that reduce its content in battery. I would also look at catalyst and previous or rare earth metals too. Unfortunately I haven't had a chance to do so much research to suggest names at this point.

As the saying goes do not trust an internet stranger. If you like the ideas.. do your own research and share your ideas too. Just note I have a very long time window in investing and generally buy a company and don't sell even if it goes through a downturn.. right now I have large losses in Albemarle and SEDG and many solar companies but I hold them.. I believe it's gonna be a rough ride but long term people will migrate to solar and now nuclear too. Similarly .. people will transition to EV but it's going to take time to do so. You can get many of these companies for cheap now btw.
Comment by baccus83: The only thing I liked better in the Tesla was the software. The Rivian is a superior vehicle in all other respects. It drives better, has a dramatically better interior, and incomparable storage space.

I haven’t tried the Hummer but that one seemed almost too big for my needs.
Comment by None: I follow all of the EVs. The hummer, the eqs mercedes, the BMW i x, the Hyundai iq, the Volvos the Volkswagens. Tesla's coming out with a new model y called the Juniper so I'm curious to see how that's going to turn out.
Title : AMZN Could Buy This Indian EV Startup. Amazon CTO’s mystery visit to Ultraviolette
Yo, what’s up with this? Amazon's CTO was spotted at Ultraviolette’s headquarters.

[https://x.com/Werner/status/1836812643589554581](https://x.com/Werner/status/1836812643589554581)

Coincidence? I don’t think so. Amazon’s been going hard on electrification. This is either a flex, or Amazon is about to make some moves in the EV space beyond Rivian and electric vans.

Ultraviolette’s F77 is already a beast, and their battery tech could make serious waves in urban mobility. Imagine if Amazon partners with them for tech licensing or even buys them. 🚀🚀

Wish I could also buy the stock, I only have the F77 motorcycle.Comment by Flegmanuachi: this is either some useless bs, or the company will moon 3-6 months down the line and we'll all be asking where those who made bank got the news first.

Title : Are European automakers headed for a death spiral?
I don't intend to exaggerate, but I am getting the sense that the auto industry in Europe (Germany especially) is on its death bed. 

## Falling Euro EV Sales / Shrinking EV Share

[Bloomberg:](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-19/germany-s-slump-in-ev-sales-drags-on-europe-s-auto-market) 

> EV deliveries in the region’s biggest car market [(Germany)] fell 69% during August, fueling a 36% drop across the region, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association said Thursday. [...] With the battery-car market share shrinking to 14% in August — down from just over 15% last year 

[Figure of the above statistics](https://i.imgur.com/5eFiBdk.png). Germany cutting subsidies was a big blow to the industry. [New car registrations also dropping](https://i.imgur.com/w9SKOjh.png). From same [Bloomberg article:](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-19/germany-s-slump-in-ev-sales-drags-on-europe-s-auto-market) 

> Across Europe, new-car registrations dropped 16.5% compared to a year ago to 755,717 million units last month with declines also in France and Italy. The UK was the only major market where EV sales rose, gaining 10.8%.

European plants are underutilized because they make more than they need. [From DW:](https://www.dw.com/en/volkswagens-crisis-how-can-europes-car-industry-survive/a-70231806)

> One in three European factories of carmaking behemoths like BMW, Mercedes, Stellantis, Renault and Volkswagen is underutilized. In some of their plants, less than half of the vehicles that could theoretically be produced are actually being made. 

## Examples of hard-hit companies

VW is planning to layoff 15K, possibly closing 2-3 plants in Germany (for the first time). Ending job security program that prevents layoffs through 2029. VW union workers are not happy and are threatening strikes. BMW cutting guidance for operating margins by 200 basis points (to 6-7%). [An Audi plant in Brussels facing closure](https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/audi-brussels-plant-closure-threat-sparks-belgium-national-strike). Stellantis plant in Italy facing 60% fall in production in 2024.


## The Threat of Chinese Exports to US/Europe

Meanwhile, China is the new auto giant. [This graph of exports by country is from early 2024](https://i.imgur.com/nPAd2wh.jpeg)--China is the Japan of the 1980s. The threat of Chinese competition is so high that EU is considering 50% tariffs (currently 15% on Chinese EVs), while the US is at 100%. In past years, I've always heard that Chinese cars are junk. Junk cars wouldn't need to need to have their price doubled to keep consumers from buying them. In other countries, Chinese brands are taking over the nascent EV market: "Chinese automakers accounted for 88% of the EV market in Brazil and 70% in Thailand in the first quarter of this year."

In Europe, despite tariffs: "Chinese carmakers' share of passenger car sales in Europe rose to 17% in the first seven months of 2024 from 12% a year earlier, according to data from automotive consultancy Inovev, and Chinese car exports have reached record highs this year." [(Reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/china-auto-suppliers-ev-makers-flood-major-trade-fair-germany-2024-09-10/).

## Shifts in China's Domestic Markets 

The Chinese automobile renaissance is killing foreign producers in China, yet another sign that these cars in China are actually comparable quality. 

> Foreign brands’ market share of Chinese auto sales is tracking at a record low of 37 per cent in the first seven months of 2024, down from 64 per cent in 2020, according to data from Automobility, a Shanghai consultancy. So far this year, US brands are down more than 23 per cent while Japanese, Korean and German carmakers have also suffered double-digit declines, the data showed. By contrast, sales of Chinese brands are up nearly 22 per cent with Chinese companies overwhelmingly dominating sales of the EV market.

[Here's Ford CEO/CFO](https://www.businessinsider.com/ford-ceo-cfo-left-shocked-after-chinese-ev-test-drive-2024-9) being shocked by the quality of Chinese EVs in a test drive. [Longer article here](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/ford-china-ev-competition-farley-ceo-50ded461?st=86lo43cq3ccgaz6&reflink=article_copyURL_share).

## Technological Edge in EVs for China?

[Nearly 40% of Chinese auto sales are of EVs](https://i.imgur.com/cqX6jts.png) versus 10% for the US and 21% for Europe. Aren't the US/EU supposed to be championing the green revolution in autos? BYD had a 5% share of Chinese cars in 2022--today it's 20%.  That's a big threat to Tesla for instance, who gets 20% of its revenue from China.

## Possible Bull Case

So  is there a bull case for VW? Here is a [Sum of the Parts](https://x.com/StanphylCap/status/1832096596319727717) bull case for Volkswagen. VW owns stakes in Porche, Traton in addition to owning Audi, VW cars, Skoda, Seat, Cupra Lamborghini, Bentley and Ducati. I don't fully understand how the debt impacts the analysis here, though. OP claims the debt is held by a captive finance arm and fully secured by leased cars + non-recourse (only collateral can be pursued, nothing more).

## Closing Thoughts

How are European automakers going to handle the competitive threat of a new Chinese auto juggernaut along with massive fiscal support in the US (from the IRA)? Their energy prices face much higher spikes [than in the US and China](https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliasferrerbreda/2023/09/21/energy-europes-big-disadvantage/). Labor unions are much more powerful in Europe, making cost cuts difficult. Autos are already a very difficult sector to invest in, but I suspect European cars brands may be uninvestible and they are rightfully cheap on a P/E basis (if earnings are even positive).

That is the reason they are so poorly managed. They know they will always get bailed out.
Comment by iqisoverrated: Automakers in Europe are 'too big to fail'. Taxpayer money will be thrown to bail them out indefinitely - too many votes depend on their survival.
Comment by siamsuper: I'm from Germany but ethnically Chinese. 

I think a huge issue is that German automakers relied on China for juicy profits.... That paid for those plushy , high paid jobs in Germany. 
In the next few years china will stop buying European cars... That's for sure. 

But... The industry is so important for Europe and Germany that we will definitely defend our home turf, bail out, invest, subsidy in any way necessary to save this industry. 
Also German/European  EVs are not half bad... For sophisticated buyers I can see people prefer a European car over a chinese one.

Comment by ChikenNoget: Honestly, VW deserves to go bust. They were founded to make cheap cars for everyone, nowadays there's not a single cheap car in their lineup. Their "cheap" Golf costs double to a Dacia that also takes you from A to B.
Additionally, they haven't innovated the last 10 years, did the same boring old designs and just copied Tesla poorly in terms of EVs.
Their software is still stuck in 2014 which is embarassing. Their employees are overpaid and lazy, they're leading the company like a soviet committee.

They are sitting on a fat pile of cash, but are still too arrogant to change their ways, even if that pile is burning right now.

God I hate VW so much
Comment by notreallydeep: If European countries keep the laws in place or even add new ones to outlaw ICEs, probably yes.

I assume they'll either extend those deadlines or scrap them completely at some point, though. Same with the subsidies, which already happened partially. For Germany in particular, the AfD, a party that openly denies climate change, is gaining more and more voters and the Green Party is losing voters, which points to a clear cultural shift. Those are two smaller parties, but between the "big two", CDU, conservatives, and SPD, more left, a similar change occurred.

>OP claims the debt is held by a captive finance arm and fully secured by leased cars + non-recourse (only collateral can be pursued, nothing more).

It is. It's funny how so many people still parrot the idea that VW is heavily indebted. You can literally just look at their reports and see the distinction between automotive and financial. It takes like a minute. VW has more cash (+ short term investments) than debt in its automotive segment iirc, I think it was like 30b vs 25b or something.
Comment by Traktorjensen: In all honesty, would you rather have a BMW or a xpeng ?
Comment by ij70: they just double down on ice sales in the rest of the world.
Comment by LarryTalbot: I think you’re right about China quietly becoming a world powerhouse automaker much like Japan did in the 80’s.  I would want to add Chinese / Swedish parent-sister relationships Geely / Polestar and Geely / Volvo to the conversation though.  Especially given both Polestar and Volvo make cars in the US, EU, and even South Korea for the new Polestar 4 Coupe.

These strategic moves by Geely were well head of the tariffs, and I would say some prescient thinking to avoid or mitigate both US and EU Chinese import tariffs on EVs.  Interestingly, EVs Polestar 3 SUV and the 3 row Volvo EX90 are both made in Volvo’s South Carolina plant which is in a free trade zone, giving additional duty free benefits on certain imported parts and components for exported vehicles, and in turn exports will earn tariff credits in the US to offset imports of the new EVs Polestar 4 from South Korea, and the compact Volvo EX30 from Ghent, Belgium coming early 2025.  Just a brilliant strategic play by Geely for their Polestar and Volvo brands in the US that makes them the only Chinese-owned EVs manufactured in the US and possibly North America, likely for years to come.

Comment by sergiu00003: As someone who watches closely Volkswagen, Mercedes and BMW, I'd say not yet. They are on a slow descending trend after a bounce off. The only thing that they have to do is **do something**. Now they are doing nothing to prevent the descending slope. They could all start to switch to 48V architectures and make everything cheaper. They could introduce gigcasting. They could also pool all their resources together to build and standardize battery sizes and capacities, they could also put everything together and standardize invertors and even engines and leave the software, interior and outlook as differentiating factor. By doing this, they could easily drive costs down for EVs to a level where they are below gas powered cars and even below Tesla's costs. But... they need strong leadership, people who are not afraid to fire incompetent managers and incompetent teams. And that kind of leadership is missing at whole Germany level. Not only in the EV sector. And would say... it's missing at EU level.
Comment by MASH12140: Who the heck wants a new car in this environment. No thanks
Comment by kormatuz: Didn’t VW get hit so hard because they lied and manipulated to make their EV cars look for eco-friendly?  I believe that case just panned out recently and that might be a big reason for the downturn.  Maybe they’ll bounce back
Comment by ENESRU: Of course they are, regardless of what anyone tells you about government bailouts or whatever bs, if companies don't adapt and are not relevant to the modern world bringing real value, they useless AKA they going to 0
Comment by None: All European carmakers have been heavy lobbying against BEV for years now.  European media are  full off "BEV will never work".   Never mind the fact that they do work IRL (see Norway).   Anti-EV examples make a good stories daily.  EV's on fire?  People stranded on their way to southern France?  Cars being too expensive?  Battery deteriorating? Battery replacement impossible?  Name all the clichés, they appear in large quantities over the media.

Today in Belgium there was a large newspaper article about that EV's are not selling, and the fact that plugin hybrids are the future and are a far better solution.  What - have - they - been - smoking?   Plug in hybrids are simply the worst possible solution to a problem.  It's better to have normal ICE's or full hybrid (like Toyota I mean), but not those underpowered PHEV...

It's just unbelievable what a mess the car-sector has made here (VW diesel scandal anyone?).   Investing in EV, at the same time making bad news about EV's.   And then yelling at the EU that BEVs don't sell.   Well they sure did their utmost best not to sell them in the first place.  And now the sector is screaming at the EU to double down on measures.?  I really hope the EU does not.

Honestly.  It's a disaster bcs topmanagement will collect their bonuses as always,  ditch the hardware,  sell of the brand to another company,  install some big \*ss consultants to save what can be saved.  And blue collar workers will be left with nothing, except a exceptional cost that has to beared by society.   As always "Profits for the shareholders, loss for the society".   Look at how Audi Brussels will turn out (I'm involved, I'm Belgian).

In my honest opinion: let them drown, do it quickly.  Let it be done with.  Sorry, I have no mercy for that kind of behaviour.

PS: my respect for Stellantis CEO Tavares to stand up today , and say that the call for postponing the EU measures is unneccessary!  At least one decent person in this circus. 

PPS: sure you can downvote me,  but be sure to sell off your stock...
Comment by vincococka: Most probable reasons not only VW failing:
- manufacture moved to China as it is cheaper - they provided China manufacture academy practically for free - who is responsible for this? Are those responsible for this still employed and earning X-figures salaries?
- Green Deal with almost impossible emission targets (is this China subvention via EU parliament ? Maybe somebody was well paid..).
- China has been preparing fo e-mobility far longer than others in the World (they have 'stolen' africa -> resources)


China (in mentality) is very very aggressive - delusional Western world not forseeing this - yay.
Comment by bartturner: Think so
Comment by Rackhham: European automakers can watch my 21 year old car keep running with a fraction of the yearly cost that would inply buying a new/2nd hand equivalent car nowadays and I say this coming from a higher position of income than the average taxpayer.


Either prices go down or, if and when I am forced to change car, I will probably go to cheapest manufacturers. 

Out of curiosity I customized an A series from Mercedes on its site recently and it quickly went to over 60K.

The car I drove right now costed 18K (minus the trade in value of a previous car) to my parents in 2003.

I wont be paying 4x for a 1.3 engine, a star on the front grill and less space in the trunk. Fuck EU manufacturers.

The first manufacturer that sells a decent 4 door sedan at a normal cost will have my business whenever it happens. I am currently against EVs for my personal situation but the BYD Seal is the closest car to my price point + what I would like a car to look like (costing between 35/46K depending on some conditions are met).

I would even roll a dice and risk getting a Alfa Romeo Giulia if it wasn't so fucking expensive.
Comment by ColdProfessional111: Renault seems to be doing well and BMW EVs are arguably among the better offerings from legacy OEMs. There will be a mix of protectionist policies and legitimate technological advancement in due time but I suspect they’ll find a way to adapt and PHEVs may be part of that. German (or German owned brands) are leading the way with some of the most performance-oriented hybrids around. Think Lamborghini, Audi, Porsche… Audi just won Dakar with an EV and has been using hybridization in world championship racing for a long time now. Let alone Formula E. They will find a way. 
Comment by SadWolverine24: If the EU puts tariffs on Chinese Automotive exports, then China will put tariffs on EU Automotive exports.

In 2023, China imported $20 billion worth of cars from the EU.
Comment by Bubbly_Mission_2641: European and US carmakers have been death spiraling for decades. It's just a question of who will survive a little longer.
Comment by PunchTornado: looking to buy a car, considering only ICE. ev is over-hyped. I'm buying the dip.
Comment by sonny_plankton3141: How the west is believing Chinese numbers is mindblowing. Chinese manufacturers are so heavily subsidized by their government that foreign companies don’t stand a chance.

However especially German manufacturers missed consumer demands spectacularly. Both ev and ice are way too expensive for what they offer. Add insane options pricing, too complex product lines, bad software and a push vor ev nobody had asked for.
Comment by Sux499: All this hinges on Europeans not going "you know what? Fuck EV's".
Comment by gizamo: The Chinese cars really aren't comparable in quality, but they have an attractive price/quality mix. They're decent cars, and they're cheap. The European/German cars are fantastic but expensive. China likes cheap, especially if it's decent *and* cheap. CCP also likes to incentivise their people to buy Chinese.
Comment by Lordoosi: The future for most european car makers is not very bright. But the chinese EV's will be kept away because of the geopolitical reasons. China is an aggressive dictatorship that supports faschist russia. It would be mad to allow them export millions of remote controlled combustible (if crashed on purpose or fried by OTA command) robots with cameras and microphones to the streets of europe/US.
Comment by Maffioze: I think calling it a death spiral is an overexaggeration but the outlook definitely isn't rosy.
Comment by stonkbuffet: European carmakers are not on their deathbed but they’ve made some extremely poor choices. VW discontinued its best selling Audi model and overpaid for rivian despite massive debt and unproven ev sales. I would never invest with them. They are setting your money on fire.

The clients that were easy to convince to buy ev’s have already bought one. Now the dealership has to argue with the customer that isn’t sold on the idea to begin with why as to why he should spend 10k more on the car and another 5k on gear. It’s a very hard sell. Car executives should have expected this. Did they not do ANY market research at all?

Lastly, Everybody wanted to move production to China to save money and now everybody is surprised that the Chinese are branding their own cars and selling them in Europe. What did you think was gonna happen?
Comment by gatormanmm1: People are over thinking this.European carmakers are screwed because they can't compete on cost. 


Chinese companies are putting out a wide array of affordable EV models, many that have features found in European model 3x the price. Tariffs will help keep Euro carmakers alive, but they will be effectively zombies, that will have their global reach heavily deminished.


Best thing for Europe is to build/maintain a strong value play in ICE. That is a segment Chinese manufacturing hasn't been able build credibility in. Europe needs to stop artificially limiting themselves with regulations. 


It's very obvious, that just because Europe makes rules and it's companies abide by them, doesn't mean other countries will do the same. Happened in Tech (with the US) and now Cars (with China).
Comment by reaper___007: What a joke is this, I am looking for an ev in europe and both Bmw ix3 and Audi q4 etron were my first choices, but to my disappointment the earliest that they can be delivered is in February 2025, as I need the car immediately I am going with Tesla Model Y most probably.

 On one side 5 months waiting period for every single model and on the other side complaining they are not selling well.
Comment by toucheqt: Due to EU's regulations the European car makers are making shitboxes that very few people want.
Comment by greenpride32: 1) Nobody wants EV's now - maybe in the future when charging stations are more ubiquitous and range is improved.

2) EU and US have done a good job imposing steep tariffs on Chinese EV's.  I think it's reasonable to expect this to continue or otherwise it's going to put some EU/US makers out of business.
Comment by draw2discard2: The biggest headwind they are facing right now, as is the case with industry in the EU (esp. Germany) generally, is that they decided to trade cheap energy for a failed Nato project in eastern Europe.
Comment by uamvar: Yes they are, until the governments step in to help.  Tesla and the Far East will (are) taking over.

Only Alfa Romeo will survive intact as they employ car designers who actually know how to design a good looking car rather than cater for the nouveau riche.
Comment by bulletinyoursocks: Well, good luck to their marketing teams.
Comment by Reasonable-Mine-2912: It’s not just Europe, the legacy auto makers in US are facing the same music. 

The US and Europe manufacturers are lost their competitive edge. The demise is just a natural progression. Raising tariffs could buy these automakers some time. But the end is inevitable.
Comment by stonk_monk42069: Okay this might sound like a joke, but I think AI will save them (or some of the at least). It will have to if we are to be able to compete with the Chinese.

Just a matter of time for the big short :)
Comment by ameerricle: VW software has been garbage. Idk what the hell management was doing for years in their software sub-company. They pretty much gutted it. Software is huge in EVs since hardware is simplified in an EV. Hopefully, Rivian pulls through for the both of them. I have not heard China's software being bad, guess they know how to use Android.
Comment by REGINALDmfBARCLAY: My coworkers VW Atlas had two gaskets start leaking at 5,000 miles and the part is on backorder for 6months so its a common problem.
Comment by anyonemous: I'm quite sure that the bigger issue is really the export of cheap government subsidised Chinese EV's.
Comment by None: And ugly.
Comment by ShadowLiberal: Their firing if Diess is really what sent them spiraling downhill in recent years IMO. They had one of the most innovative CEOs pushing their EV transition, but they decided to fire him because the transition was too much short term pain.
Comment by PSfreak10001: But the problem arise from the fact that Automakers do not sell enough EV's. The factories are there and the billions in R&D are invested, the only thing missing are the costumers. It's not like people are buying less ICE's only because they are offering more EV's. 

I'm afraid that going easy on EV regulation and scrapping the outlaw of newly sold ICE are doing more harm to the companies than doing good in the next decade. They can still use any ICE technology in Hybrids from now one, so the only investment that needs securing are EV's. 

  
Also parties like the Afd are profiting of a recession, the unhappiness with Corona and immigration, once the economy gets back on track and people forget about getting the vaccines, these parties are going back to the hole they deserve to be in.
Comment by Pitiful_Special_8745: Wrong comparison.

The real one is: would you rather buy  1.0 Kia Piacanto for 15,000 Euro base model econobox.

Or a Xinchinchang Bambalam for 4,000 Euros that does the same economic job.

If you have 50K you go for the BMW. But 90% of people just need a ride form A to B.
Comment by bar_tosz: Stupid take. Would you rather have a Ferrari or BMW? 

If BMW cost the same as Xpeng than I would take BMW but those are not competitors.
Comment by analbuttlick: I’d rather have a BMW, but xpeng is selling for half the price with more options included. For now china is taking over in Norway. BYD, polestar and Xpeng have really established themselves
Comment by Savings-Seat6211: This question would track more 20 years ago. People dont care about badges as much now or if they do its not BMW.
Comment by KrazyKraka: Saying this as a BMW fan. 
If I were to chose an EV, good chance I would take a Xpeng or a Zeekr above the BMW. And don’t even get me started on Mercedes
Comment by irregular_caffeine: Almost anything but a BMW, really
Comment by Malawi_no: BMW make good or even great EV's.  
When comparing to VAG the picture is a bit different. Looks nice and handles nice, but soo many errors ang bugs.
Comment by AP9384629344432: I think China is eating Europe's lunch in both EVs and ICEs, though. Their auto exports are skyrocketing but it is still 60% ICE, so it's not just EV exports that are booming.
Comment by None: I don't see Volvo Cars as a Chinese brand, it's listed on Nasdaq Stockholm and has it's HQ in Sweden, so it's technically a european brand, it's however majority owned by Geely, but you can buy shares in it right now.
Comment by Lorax91: > Plug in hybrids are simply the worst possible solution to a problem. It's better to have normal ICE's or full hybrid (like Toyota I mean), but not those underpowered PHEV...

My PHEV has as much electric power as some fully electric cars, and can drive at highway speeds without using the gas engine. Then on long trips I don't have to deal with charging infrastructure issues, which in the US are a hot mess. So for me it's been a good solution to current circumstances, on the way to a fully electrified transportation future. And since the original post mentioned China, note that one-third of their electrified vehicles are PHEVs. 

As far as stocks are concerned, no argument that these are tough times for older automakers. But if they're allowed to fade away, what takes their place in economies where they've been big contributors?
Comment by awastandas: The actual reason is much simpler. The Germans can't get cheap Russian gas anymore, and you can't have an industrial economy without cheap energy. So their manufacturing sector will die a slow death as a consequence. 

China has cheap energy. The US has cheap energy. France has cheap energy. India, Vietnam, Indonesia, etc. etc.
Comment by RonTom24: > China (in mentality) is very very aggressive

Here's me thinking the country that has 800 military bases all over the world and has been involved in every war going for the last 70 years is the aggresive one.
Comment by jjshen11: Same for US IT companies.
Comment by None: BEV is the only way. 

Don't trust media or car lobby over it.  

But you are right that an ICE is better than a plug in EV.
Comment by xyq071812: "Chinese manufacturers are so heavily subsidized by their government that foreign companies don’t stand a chance."

how so? I'm in China and I just bought a Tesla, I don't get any extra incentives from buying domestic car brands. The real killer here is battery supply chain and software integration, not subsidies.
Comment by WhyEveryUnameIsTaken: "Europe needs to stop artificially limiting themselves with regulations. "

This is the main issue with the EU, and not just regarding cars. The bureaucracy is pathetically complicated, and it's not even effective.
Comment by DahlbergT: Europe makes the most desirable vehicles in the world. That they also happen to make small econoboxes doesn’t mean shit. If there’s a market for it, the big boys like VW will go for it.
Comment by PSfreak10001: Ah yes, shitboxes such a BMW or Porsche or Audi, really unliked brands these. I would hate to have to drive a Range Rover or an X5, crappy little ecoboxes as they are.
Comment by AP9384629344432: Which regulations? [I have simultaneously seen people in this thread/elsewhere complaining about Europe being too far behind with switching to EVs and also about regulators pushing companies too hard about switching to EVs]
Comment by ShadowLiberal: > I think it's reasonable to expect this to continue or otherwise it's going to put some EU/US makers out of business.

If the tariffs are so good for the EU automakers then why are pretty much all of them opposing the tariffs?

They know full well that this will just cause them to start losing market share in China even faster then they already are.
Comment by alex20_202020: Cars altogether. Biking is the way. And walking. And public transport.
Comment by AP9384629344432: What's the relevance of AI here? Self-driving cars? China (XPeng + BYD) + Tesla + Waymo are already making large strides here. No reason to think Europe will have a sudden edge here (nor that there is a moat per se here).

But what US and Japan EV cars??
US car makers cancel their EV plans and japans Toyota is betting on hydrogen not EV.
Comment by slicheliche: This analysis has me lol honestly.

China's cars are cheap and (half) decent. Not good. Decent. I wouldn't trust them on the road but if you don't have any alternative.

USA cars, if you mean Tesla, are trash AND overpriced. They're also massively subsidised, like the Chinese brands by the way. I live in an European country and people here tend to despite Teslas for good reason (unless you got a lot of money, and even then).

Japanese cars are good ish (Toyota at least) but definitely not cheap. No particular reason to pick them over German or French brands as they compete in the same price and quality segment. Most of them are also massively behind on the EV transition. 

In fact, the entire industry is in crisis. Even within China, the transition combined with the economic slowdown is causing a production glut that is flooding the market with subpar cars and killing all but a handful of large brands.
Comment by heel-and-toe: China has cheap EVs. US and Japan do not stand well here. I think the big question is how much money put in the last 10 years the chinese guvernment in the EV industry (how many free money poured in the EV companies). How much it costs the chinese to make the batteries and at what environmental price. How their workers are paid, and how much of the current car price is supporte by the chinese guverment. 

European car producers received some support from the EU countries in the form of cost sharing at the car putchaae. They did not receive help
for developing batteries and the EV cars. The EU and US do not have a battery producing industry. Not by far at the scale the Chinese have. They do
not destroy their environment like chinese do.

Competing with the chinese in these conditiions
is impossible. And with the China market almost dead to the European and US car manufacturers, their fate is not good at all. They were making most of their profits there, and now they make none.
Comment by TaxGuy_021: Cause surviving and thriving are two different things. 


EU governments, Germans particularly, would rather pay subsidies to these entities than pay unemployment and deal with the social issues.


That doesn't mean they are going to be profitable.
Comment by Kaymish_: Because often a government will wipe out the shareholders and convert bond holders when bailing out a company. Bailouts ant too big to fail are irrelevant to investors because we get wiped out even if there is no bailout.
Comment by iqisoverrated: Yes, I'd agree to that. I wouldn't risk a single euro on our domestic auto makers.

Comment by siamsuper: I think these are a threat but can be managed in Europe.
Comment by ChinaNo_one: Because low-income countries cannot build large-scale charging piles. The radius of use of electric vehicles is very narrow and cannot be used for long-distance driving. Therefore, the internal combustion engine is still the mainstream. But China also has cheap Geely and Great Wall fuel vehicles to compete with Japanese and German brands
Comment by None: But not as ugly as BMW's.
Comment by WolfsBaneViking: Audi people dont care as long as it has the 5 zeros
Comment by RonTom24: Intel shareholders are trying to do the same thing with Pat Gelsinger at the moment, shareholders are the worst, they only care about quarterly earnings reports and the stock price, they couldn't give two shits about long term goals if they effect the money here and now.
Comment by Traktorjensen: It's two different classes you can't really compare. A brand like xpeng is set out as a direct competition to bmw or polestar, they say so themselves.

But Europe is selling luxury, build quality and maybe something a bit more conservative in terms of looks ( I like them way better, Mercedes ev is ugly though)
Comment by slicheliche: The best selling cars in Norway are VW, Volvos, and Toyotas with a (declining) share of Teslas. No Chinese brands in sight. Norwegians can afford better.
Comment by hoppydud: Polestar is Chinese?
Comment by kuvrterker: I went to a mazda dealership for my new car and I saw 12 used polestars on the lot. People are getting it then trading it in for better cars
Comment by ShadowLiberal: The Chinese are doubling down on EV's, not really ICE vehicles. EV's are China's chance to rise in the auto market and steal a bunch of market share, ICE vehicles aren't since the incumbents are too good at them and have too much of a moat.

China wants to be the #1 leader in EV's, and they basically are outside of Tesla. Just about all the top 20 or so best selling EV's worldwide are made by either Tesla or a Chinese company.
Comment by LarryTalbot: Yes you are correct…Geely has about 78% ownership.  They bought them from Ford in 2010 for a ridiculously low $1.8b and did a partial IPO a few years ago.  R&D is in Sweden, corporate offices, etc.  EV production on the EX30 is in a new plant north of Beijing.  Polestar 2 also is made in China.  I also think this branding was smart b/c at least for Volvo, and soon more widely Polestar, there is a solid reputation for quality in the west, and these are seen as EU brands.  That is not by accident.  Yes, both are traded on US OTC.
Comment by None: I have a BEV since March 23.  I had zero charging inftrastructure issues up to today.   Examples are no data I'm aware.   The experience I had with PHEV is underwhelming.  A 1.4l or even 1.2l underpowerd engine, combined with a small 14kwh battery with equally small powertrain, combined with a 30l fuel tank.  Putting it togetter having an astmatic car (and no, I do not point at Rav4 prime here) , with a range of 400km at max. Less than my EV now.  When travelling no possibility to have fast charging.   Still having to go to a dealer for maintenance.  I see only disadvantages.   And imho: the resale value will be next to nothing.   If not a BEV, I would rather buy a classic ICE now.

As far as "what takes their place in economies where they've been big contributors?".

Have they been contributors?  Of course they are.   But to what extent?    Taking into account every single cost.  Big subsidies (Audi Brussels).  Pre-pension regulations waiving cost on the society.    Not to forget environmental cost.   Promoting car-centric societies.   Deductibility of cars (typically for my country).  Having exported our know how to China (the boomerang is coming in).    Etc Etc.

I'm not even starting on dealerships.  Many of them being good people squeezed by carmakers.

My compassion is very low.
Comment by vincococka: Causality...

I mentioned reasons that are far more distant in past than 'cheap energy' and theese are most probably more related to the current issues than energy prices (which are only one of the last nails in the...)
Comment by xyq071812: China does not have cheap energy, it imports 60% of oil and coal. That's why China is all in on green energy
Comment by vincococka: Definitely - different sort of aggreasion.
China is like hydra - it eats from inside without being fully aware of whats going on.
Comment by Y0tsuya: China subsidizes on the supply side while US and Euros subsidize on the demand side.  It's the same for solar panels for example.  China subsidizes solar panel manufacturers while US subsidizes panel buyers.  End result is a steady flow of cheap panels from China to US while American solar panel factories go out of business.

As a rule of thumb, if an analysis is formatted like 4chan greentext, it's not much of an analysis.
Comment by CheetaLover: I was at Shanghai Auto Show last year. There is such a huge span in Chinese car brands with quite a few quite expensive and seemingly good quality making the European brands look dull. American cars including Tesla has very little to offer if you don’t look at nostalgia. Also if Eu puts tariffs on Chinese EV they will kill the German brands depending on exports to China. If you can’t beat them, join them, I think is where we are now. Biggest owner of Volvo and Mercedes is Mr Li Shufu
Comment by None: [removed]
Comment by hootix: You underestimate Chinese car especially BYD. They are way more than decent and are the reason that western tarifs on china don't want to lower it.
Comment by dubov: But the government is shutting off the competition and bailing them out that way?
Comment by __jazmin__: Just look at how the US government screwed GM’s owners. They stole it and paid out only 11% on their corporate bonds. 
Comment by anyonemous: Paywall
Comment by anyonemous: The same subsidies affect the Chinese market too. Bottomline is without those subsidies Chinese EV's would have a much harder time competing with German import.
Comment by ChikenNoget: Tbh Gelsinger said some pretty idiotic stuff recently that makes many people question him. Said Core speed is less important now, they want to focus on their products to be used as connecting AI cards. Core Speed and efficiency is all that fucking matters to private Consumers and normal businesses
Comment by MirrorCrazy3396: You can say whatever you want, doesn't make it true.
Comment by analbuttlick: Actually the best selling car in Norway is Tesla. I never said Chinese cars were dominant, but they have established themselves. They have much more brands available and a lot more volume than they had earlier. Byd are really gaining traction. They just released 2 new models, seal U and another one that i’m pretty sure will receive decent traction.
Comment by Plenty-Tune4376: Yes, like Volvo, it belongs to Geely.
Comment by Lorax91: I've been on roads in the US where it's over 250 miles (400 km) between EV fast chargers, unless you have a Tesla - and even their charging network has a few weak areas. The situation will improve now that Tesla is finally opening up some of their chargers to other EVs here, but that's a slow process. 

According to the following article from last year, the European auto industry directly accounts for four million jobs and 3% of Europe’s GDP:

Comment by DenisWB: China imports less than 10% of coal
Comment by cambon: Cheap?
Comment by PooInTheStreet: Decent?
Comment by Educational-Year4108: Rivian isn’t cheap. Tesla is cheap but mostly with quality and interior
Comment by gizamo: This is absurd. I've driven Mercedes and Nio. The comparison isn't even close. Nio is close to VW, but not even remotely close to Audi, or BMW for that matter. The Chinese cars are good, but most importantly, they're cheaper. They absolutely are not better, not even close.   
     
French? Lol. That's not relevant, mate.   
    
Edit: btw, I'm in China every year or every other year. I've driven a bunch of brands. None were as good as German cars.

Comment by MirrorCrazy3396: This is reddit where people who can barely afford a low end car talk about how bad Tesla is because Elon isn't an NPC like they are.

Then again a high end German car is obviously better than a way lower end American/Japanese car, you're paying a premium for that after all. I'm not surprised that my BMW is better than my Volkswagen, it also cost x3 more so it's kind of expected.
Comment by tothecrossroads: BYD is copy and paste, heavily subsidized and a company weaponized for political purposes.
Comment by TaxGuy_021: No competition still doesnt mean profitable. 

Why would they be profitable? Particularly if it requires hard work and making hard decisions?

The management can do the hard thing and be profitable or do the easy thing and never go bust.
Comment by DenisWB: The car sells for €20,500 ($21,950) in China and €42,000 ($45,000) in the EU. 

Chinese automakers are moving to extract higher profits in Europe as a price war back home pushes their margins to the floor. This pricing mechanism means the Seal U makes BYD a €14,300 ($15,300) profit in the EU, but just a €1,300 ($1,400) profit in China.
Comment by siamsuper: Well it is how is. 
China will always be a state driven model not a free market.
Comment by KrazyKraka: Yes because Europe has definitely not been subsidizing its automotive industry right? Right? 

And basing your entire business model on milking the Chinese cash cow without seeing the market was shifting to EVs was totally not their fault either.

Comment by Pas2739: Lies
Comment by dubov: Well how can you not be profitable if you can put the price wherever you need it and customers don't have much choice but to buy from you?
Comment by anyonemous: Not even close to the level of subsidies Chinese EV makers have received, $231 billion in the last 15 years.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-21/china-s-ev-makers-got-231-billion-in-aid-over-last-15-years

Besides most subsidies in Europe have come in the form of tax incentives for the buyers. 

Milking the Chinese cash cow?

It's just that China has a huge population and is relatively wealthy.

Per capita other countries spend far more on German cars. 

20 billion in sales in China in 2023 for roughly 1,4 billion inhabitants and 17 billion in sales in the US for roughly 340 million inhabitants.

Just face it, it's unfair competition. 

The only point I partly agree with is that German car manufacturers hould have had more foresight.

Comment by Amoral_Abe: No it cannot.  You can literally go through the steps to see what you would pay.  Here's the results per Tesla.  
   
Base Price (No Credits):            635/m for 72m = $45,720  
Base Price (If granted credits): 515/m for 72m = $37,080
  
Keep in mind, the second number is Tesla saying what you would effectively be paying if you got full government credits back.  Most people don't get maximum so it's more realistic to say this is a $40k-$45k car.
Comment by cambon: Not bad that! 

 UK price is $60000 for the base model
Comment by Septon-Meribald: Teslas average 55k in Europe. It is a luxury brand. EV demand will increase once we get sub 30k products. 

Most ev Models are in the 50-100k range.
Comment by gizamo: Utter nonsense. Not that German cars have great software, but the Chinese cars have much worse. Imo, all cars have crap software, tho.

...and that's what I found just from 2/3 minutes doing a couple of google searches, this isn't even me investigating it thoroughly and I've found $30.6 billion in subsidies from just Germany and France since 2020, so in the last 4 years from just two of the EU's big automakers. I have no doubt whatsoever, if I went thoroughly over the last 15 years of EU auto industry subsidies, I would find an amount equal to or possibly exceeding China's total.
Comment by KrazyKraka: that $231bn number is bs, just look at how it’s calculated. And that’s to get an entire industry off the ground. If you knew this industry you’d know very well that pales in comparison to the number of times the European auto industry has been bailed out over the years (these companies would have been long bankrupt without it).

Comment by ChikenNoget: That tells me you haven't driven a single chinese one lmao.
Comment by anyonemous: Sure but the the 231 billion figure that is quoted is conservative and doesn't include incentives for locals to switch to EV's among others. Whereas that's what the majority of the European car subsidies have been for. So you're really comparing apples to oranges. 

Anyway, I am not passing any value judgements, if China can compete that way then why shouldn't they. Just stating the facts. It has helped them scale up and develop quickly allowing them low production costs for what are quality vehicles as it looks now. 

And I won't deny that European countries have heavily subsidized their car industry, but there are some differences in the forms of subsidies and motives. A bailout is not the same as an export boost.
Comment by anyonemous: Easy to call BS without backing up any of your own claims
