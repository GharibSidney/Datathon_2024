Title : What is ONE idea or mindset you hold onto with dear life when making investment decisions? Here is mine:
As a disclaimer, I am not trying to ''educate'' anyone or act like I know it all. I am far from an expert, and I will never consider myself as such out of respect for the complexity of stock-picking, but after reading the major works of Howard Marks, Graham, Buffet, Munger, and having observed my own behavior and others around me during good and bad times, my major approach sums up to the following sentence:

"You're neither right nor wrong because people agree with you or disagree with you. In other words, being contrarian has no special virtue over being a trend follower. You’re right because your facts and reasoning are right."

(Not sure if Buffet or Graham said it, but anyways)

It might seem like an obvious statement, but in my experience it's far from it...

I think there is a reason why Munger states knowledge in psychology and human nature is of immense importance when it comes to investment decisions, likewise, I also understand now why they are so critical of some business schools and their way of approaching the market; as if it was a robotic machine with predictable outcomes with no interference of human emotions.

I read news a lot and like to I listen to people, and I have noticed that when times are good, people will always rationalize over why a stock will continue increasing. Not too long ago, if we take Meta as an example, you wouldn't hear too many bad things being said about it. A safe blue chip stock, has monopolized all social media, and what not... But now that it has taken a major nose-dive (in stock price, very unproportional to corresponding loss of the company itself) you will hear everywhere, from analysts, people, news outlets that it's ''over'', the future looks ''hazy'', ''TkTok is rising'', ''Metaverse won't work out'' Whatever... I am not into that stuff, they might be right, and they might be wrong. I don't know. But the point is, if people truly had the conviction they had previous to the nose-dive, now would be the perfect time to invest a huge chunk in such a company. But most don't, this just proves it was all a bluff. They never truly believed in it, it was all emotions. Once again, psychology... Human emotions... Just like when times are good, they only saw the strengths of the company and no weaknesses, now that times are bad, they can only see the weakness of the company and no strengths, and they can only come up with reasons why it might go to shit.

Same thing with Tesla right now, I look around me and the majority can only see what's fantastic about the company. They have the best production rate, the best factories, the best batteries, the best engineers, branding power, whatever... I don't even know whether it's true, I'm not into this sector, this is just what I hear all the time around me. How would the opinions of majority of these people change if say Tesla nose-drived like Meta or Alibaba did right now? Say 50-60% because of just one missed quarter? I am willing to bet people will start saying ''the automobile industry is tough'', ''VW's catching up, their engineers are better...''.

Now those are just generalized examples to get my point across, but bottom line is, behavior like this is not surprising to me anymore, and there is a reason only a selected few will achieve desirable outcomes long-term, because as the quote in the beginning states, it's not about being a contrarian for the sake of being contrarian, or just following the flow. It's about making rational decisions and having this ''temperament'' that is often talked about, so that you're not dragged down by the panic and mania around you.Comment by Realdeal43: One of the funny things about the stock market is that every time one person buys, another sells, and both think they are astute.

Comment by Signal_Ad657: You never have to sacrifice on a stock purchase.  It’s not like baseball where you have to swing at the pitch.  You can wait and let 1,000 pitches go by and when you get your perfect shot, knock it out of the park.  And after you do that?  You can wait 1,000 more pitches to do it again.  You don’t always have to be in, you don’t ever need to buy something just to stay invested.  If you get a big win, remember… YOU WON!  You don’t have to give that money back.  You can keep it, save it, spend it, or just relax and wait for your next perfect opportunity.  You don’t have to swing at anything other than your perfect pitch.
Comment by Spork_Warrior: Buy low, sell high.
Comment by GainsOnTheHorizon: Liz Ann Sonders (Schwab) recently highlighted a difference between retail investors and the market.  Retail investors tend to look at good vs bad... the stock fell recently, or it's down from highs.  But the market views things as "getting better" or "getting worse", and not in absolute terms.  Facebook got hit by Apple and then Google changes that made targetted advertising harder - that's a direct threat to Facebook's income.  If you don't think they can fix it, lower prices could even be justified (I think they will figure it out).  But the point is sometimes sentiment changes after an important change to the business, and it may look tied to the stock drop rather than the change which casued the stock drop.

Comment by Master-Nose7823: It’s a large mistake to watch or read financial news. There’s always an agenda. Very little of it is fundamental company analysis performed by the likes of people who are compensated by being correct picking stocks.
Comment by Mister_Titty: When stocks make big moves, there is always a reason behind it. The reason may not be obvious. And you may never learn the reason. But there is always a reason. Big money doesn't just throw hundreds of millions of dollars in one direction or another without a reason.

Often times the reason becomes evident over time. Maybe a stock jumps 20% over a month, then 3 months later it comes out that Fidelity or BRK took a stake in them. Then it pops again temporarily on hype because of the news 😆.  Just an example.

If the whole market is awash in a sea of red but one stock is unchanged "for no reason", believe me when I say there is a reason.

And on very rare occasions, the reasons are wrong. That's where opportunity comes into play. Buying the dip only makes sense if there is a reason for the stock to go higher in the future.

If you can figure out the actual causes behind why a particular stock moves, you can be very profitable.

Comment by birdlives_ma: The fundamental point you're making isn't wrong per se, but Facebook is a terrible example of it. 

All the bull cases you listed were real until the Facebook papers came out, which was one of the biggest bombshells of negative press a company's gotten in years. They then announced a complete pivot of their business plan, to something most people think is really stupid. That's not market psychology, that's real life events effecting the outlook of the company.
Comment by Reddituser183: Investing is long term. Buying and selling short term is not investing, it’s scalping which is dangerous because you cannot predict which way things are going short term. Constantly paying attention to every up and down of markets and making gut decisions based on those movements is pure gambling and you will lose your shirt. Investing long term is the only way to go, unless you have a degree and work in the industry. Don’t pay attention to outliers like GME kittyman. You might as well play power ball if your shooting for that type of return. 

Find good companies that are producing quality products and services. Buy them, when the market drops, buy them when the market rises. In the long term they’ll pay off. That’s it. You have to look at the big picture. You can’t look at what’s happening day to day. If you’re looking at  a single tree you’ll miss the entire forest. You’re entire last paragraph is perfect.
Comment by LCJonSnow: I realize this is leading to missing a lot of opportunities, but sticking to a reasonable TTM PE. I mistrust growth projections (including my own), so want to find something where it’s already performing at that level and i think those earnings are at least representative of what is going forward. Any growth is extra to me at that point.
Comment by Mission_Count_5619: Sometimes the best thing to do is nothing. Not that I don’t take profits or move out bad positions. When things are highly volatile my strategy is to walk away from chart checking and let things play out.

Comment by None: Be systematic. It doesn’t matter how you make your investment decisions, as long as you can make it into a system (set of rules) that can be incrementally improved, you’re going to come out a winner.

For some, their system is just to buy every paycheck. For others, it means analyzing a company’s fundamentals. Others use quantitative methods. These systems all make money.

You start losing money when your decision making starts to become based on intuition/feelings.
Comment by Somethingexpected: I think a case example of this are all the seeking alpha etc. community analyses where they recommend to buy a stock after a "thorough" review. At the same time, they disclose that they hold no positions nor are they going to.

It makes no sense. If they spend the time and effort to analyse, and it's a buy to them, they should also own the stock. That is, if they trust their own analysis. And to me it's way less fishy if they own a "buy" stock. Even if one can argue they only wrote the analysis to prop a share price of a stock they own. Like, why wouldn't they, if they believe in the company and undervaluation?

In other words, I simply don't trust most analysts to know what they're doing.
Comment by zomgitsduke: I almost never sell. Everything is a 10+ year hold. I rebalance my portfolio by buying things to balance it.

Comment by dolpherx: It's funny you say that about tesla, when all I see is everyone swaying they are overvalued, there is no way they can be worth more than thr whole US auto industry etc. I guess what you hear is also part of the bias as you tend to hear what you want to hear whether to confirm what you think or for the contrarian, to go against what you think.

But there is one point I find might need clarity in your post. It almost seems you think that people have good feelings about it then buy, while there are people like this it should be first based on facts then you determine a judgment.

With the meta example, say if you were into meta before, if they show new information that is permanently damaging, then you should sell. You shouldn't think it's a bargain.

Same thing with tesla. If there is a new better tesla out there, then it will permanently lower tesla value. But if just a shutdown of a factory for a week in China, this is a temporary effect.

Comment by SpectralAllure: The reality of running with the herd is that your ultimate destination is the slaughterhouse.

Comment by Calm_Leek_1362: Stories sell stocks. 

This might be my personal thesis, but here goes. 

The different styles of investing (TA, garp, value, momentum,  short squeeze, etc...) aren't right or wrong. Each one produces stories that people can connect with. The emotional response is what causes people to buy or sell. The same as any other product. Excitement over growth, a feeling of safety provided by in depth analysis and low p/e, a narrative about a short squeeze that will cause the stock to sky rocket and cause pain to institutions, the future of the auto industry... the investing style you prefer is a statement about you as a person. 

 These are all just stories with emotional reasons to buy. If any of them worked perfectly, there'd be no reason for additional discussion. The market would be efficient. But it's not. 

On the flip side, selling takes place for the same reasons. Fear because of war and inflation, ecstacy of taking profits, concerns about the future growth of the company on the metaverse.  Nobody knows what will happen next, but the stories and the emotions they cause affect the price more than the health and success of the company.

So how do I buy? I like to buy the dip on companies that have nothing wrong with them, but sentiment has driven prices down.  ATVI was my best pick last year, when all the terrible allegations came to light.  The Financials of the company were stellar, so you let the narrative drive the price down and buy knowing that the company will survive even if they have to fire most of their management team. So it tends towards value investing, but I love a good story.

That revenue was taken away really quickly and it is like you said when people just looked the other way.  Facebook had it coming and I never really invested big money in them. 

The idea I hold onto for dear life is that I hit homeruns off stocks I didn't expect to versus losing money off of the homeruns I thought were coming.  So I do better with lower trading volume and time.  Cast a wide net and invest over a wide range of stocks .. I have 33 invested companies now.  And I try hard to invest the same amount over each.  It doesn't take much to catch a runner and really get 20% off of a stock.  Just my opinion..

Comment by kkInkr: Investment is something I can afford to lose at any given time, and while I have no time to attend to it, it still grows on its own, beating inflation overtime and until retirement I am not going to sell it. Nothing beats consistency with always win strategy. No need to worry about any situation affecting investment is the key to win. Broad Market index funds are easier to handle than any sector ETFs and individual stocks because we are all factors of the economy, and so unemployment, spendings, etc are factors affecting those indices, knowing those and investing to the right index, will yield better than interest rate in the long run. How many people count their lives in their investment is the question people usually don't ask themselves before any strategy. The decision you said is part of the grand scheme of the question, do you count it as part of your life, and if it is too much of a burden, will you continue to input money? If you treat it as life or death, you don't answer it easily, or else you rely on a much less risky investment than sector ETFs or individual stocks.

I have mixed feelings about TSLA.  I was there when the roadster first made its debut, it was indeed an earth-shattering product similar to the Iphone.  It has problems executing and suffers from a bit too much vision and not enough product, but what it's known for is pretty exciting.  Please don't ask me why I'm not a multimillionaire with my 2000 shares bought at 20.  All I'll say is "options". =(

Anyway, a nice smooth read, it's refreshing to see something other than "what happened last week??!?" on this forum.

Loss cutting is preferred because there's an assumption that the next trade is going to be a win.  Reality is probably quite different in many cases.

This is exactly what would happen, but anyone who's really done their homework on Tesla knows that deliveries, earnings or margins - no matter how impressive they all are - are far from their most important metric as long as the trend doesn't break over multiple quarters.

As for your question, my point would be: Investigate the leadership of a company before anything else. Every company work from the top down. If the management decisions suck, the CEO has no vision or is dishonest (tons of examples just in the automotive sector, GM, BMW, Toyota, Nikola, Lordstown, even Lucid to some degree), or guidance is constantly miles ahead of actual results, you don't want to be in that stock.

Comment by Immediate-Assist-598: Here are a few rules from a veteran investor.  Never put money into highly risky fad assets like memes, penny stocks, companies that haven't made money yet or alternative digital assets with no underlying value.  That is like buying lottery tickets or going to vegas. Odds are you will lose and with some of them you can lose 100%.  when I was young, I lost 50% and 100% on two investments by following a get-rich-quick fad.   Remember, not losing money is the same as winning money, so lower your odds of losing by investing only in real world solid profitable companies.

Convictions can change base on new information. For me, the big information is that the ios lockout of Facebook is strangling Facebook's advertising business. Facebook at first claimed they are working on a solution, but my friends tell me in the industry that Facebook does not have a solution. 

Having said that, I do think Facebook has gone down too low, even considering the ios problems. I sold a put at $185, as that is my entry point for this stock.
Comment by campionesidd: There are many investing principles I keep in mind, but one that I think is particularly relevant right now is: when it comes to buying equities, ignore macroeconomics and focus on how the company is performing.

Comment by dansdansy: You can tilt the odds in your favor by making trades when the other side is more likely to be making emotional decisions (despair/euphoria). Contrarian moves right after big news run ups like Elon's TWTR stock announcement are a good example.

Comment by 2econdclasscitizen: Intraday trading isn’t ‘investing’, I don’t think - it’s taking a position intended to secure profit based on data; reacting to signals the market gives, through a purely self-interested probability-focused lens. 

To ‘invest’ is to use your capital to give a third party support with their commercial activity, in the hope that both they and you will benefit in some way, based on your respective interests and needs at a given time. 

That said, short-term trading does normally increase liquidity, which usually isn’t a bad thing
Comment by Awpss: This is a cool sounding quote but what does this really mean? The entire city of Vegas doesn’t have the same odds. Odds are different in different games. You have a higher chance of winning a blackjack hand than hitting the red 36 on the roulette table for example 

Are you referring to the how many people leave Vegas profitable?
Comment by YT-AnArtAccount: May I ask for some examples or positions you have/had this happen too? Debating if I want to start a Dividend portfolio (23) and putting some research into it. So just curious about some examples :)
Comment by None: On this grain long term investing in value is a great way to beat the market. Some of us can’t, or don’t want to, slow down, but if we were to look at a 5 year investment strategy rather than 1 month or even 1 week for a lot of us it would make things much easier, depending on how you look at it. This is something I’ve failed to do since working for an investment manager about 10 years ago. I always focused on what would make money the fastest, i.e. options. A lot of us are fast enough to do the reasearch to be able to find good and great companies, and companies with deep value, but sticking to that strategy for the long term is easier said than done when you see 100s of % being made daily in FD’s or other quick ways.

Comment by QuaintHeadspace: I like this one. Right now everyone and their grandma is saying a recession is right around the corner this makes me uneasy not because I actually think it's true. Its just if all think that then surely its likely not going to happen. Everyone thinks it's coming but every single big event has been sell the rumour buy the news the market keeps rallying over and over. 

My logic is 

1. Bonds are trash right now due to inflation
2. Cash is trash due to inflation
3. Alot of big big firms went to cash from November and now are seeking somewhere to actually put it
4. Equities are the only place to make money when it seems inevitable that real estate is about to cool down due to alot more people turned down for mortgages lowering prices

Where else can people put money apart from equities?

It's never mistake. You just have to watch / read with mindset that is shows what others want you to think.
Comment by GainsOnTheHorizon: It's very isolated going against the entire market, but I did that in March 2020.  To keep an eye on what the market knew or expected, I watched hours of financial news a day - I had to know when the market figured out what I already knew days in advance.  So for an active investor in a contrarian position, "listening to the enemy", if you will, makes sense.
Comment by louistran_016: My mindset is heavy skepticism on Jim Cramer news, not doing exactly the opposite, but asking ourselves why do they push this piece of info and how they will benefit from it
Comment by Calm_Leek_1362: Do your own DD. It's weird how YouTube talkers and business insider are kind of an echo chamber because they are so thirsty for content.  You might have 1 or 2 people do convincing dd on a stock, then 100 will start parroting it like they discovered it. So when you hear about stocks this way, it feels like there are a lot of people with high convicting and it's easier to buy. 

I've found that it's much harder to do make your own moves without hearing somebody hype it up first, because you have to trust that you're right and the market hasn't caught on yet (which is saying something because millions of people are trying to make money on the market every day). It's easier to doubt yourself too, when you buy and there's no price action for a long time.
Comment by madrox1: I dont agree with its a large mistake to watch or read financial news. You just need to be able to filter the information and form your opinions on facts that are presented. Even if you want to deny it, cnbc and bloomberg provide financial facts and stock news. You might not agree with certain opinions or certain analysts pushing a stock but that doesnt mean the network isnt providing facts and relevant news.

Comment by proverbialbunny: If you employed a 50/50 strategy bot that bought and sold randomly, you'd end up losing money over time in relation to its index.  There is a house.  It's trading fees and money makers giving bad fills.  It's also interest from leverage, eg theta, margin interest, LETF fees, and so on.

The odds are roughly on par with a roulette wheel without leverage.  With leverage the odds are further against you.

Comment by None: I don’t day trade but I have friends who do and have looked into/researched strategies… the best abstract I can provide you is that you need to research a company and try to assign a value to the stock… basically create a method of calculating your own “stock price” based oj what you believe it is worth… then compare that against what the stock is currently selling for and if you can buy it for less than your own evaluation and you’re confident in your process… invest.

Comment by None: Sure, its all part of learning how to do your due diligence. You have to look at yoy eps and revenue, you have to check the quarterly balance sheet, is debt increasing or decreasing, check cash flow it is increasing or decreasing, compare dividends paid to cash from operations can it cover it? Then look at the 5 year chart, ling term up trend or down trend?

Even a crappy company with no future *can* be a great short term investment if you know the Wall Street Journal is about to run a piece on it singing its praises.

I'd recommend another approach: find his stock picks amusing.  You don't need to invest in them or short term - you can just let them go by.  Sometimes Jim Kramer will highlight something interesting, or interview a CEO, or talk to an analyst who knows something valuable.  You can miss all that if you're distracted by your emotional reaction to Jim Kramer.

But I won't touch something with a TTM PE of <20 on principle, unless I knew it was a one time weird expense driving things down.
Comment by Somethingexpected: Yes, as I said, they are community analyses. But the same applies to banks and investors. When you don't put your own money where your mouth is, why would I? And if you're overinvested, buy recommendations are also suspicious to say the least.

Independent analyses seem to be mostly a sham to get more readers and figuring out good from the bad can be difficult. Practically always the best info is from the stock companies themselves with their forward guidance coupled with understanding of the macro environment.
Comment by GainsOnTheHorizon: Some people need a broad statement like "nobody knows anything" to understand the meaning, even if you can find flaws in specific cases.  It's a starting point or guidepost: you start assuming nobody knows anything, and put more value in your own research.
Comment by F1shB0wl816: One can make a smart decision for themselves but that’s also where it ends. What’s smart for one, isn’t for another. Ones mindsets, factors and agenda can all be different, yet they all be subjectively smart. 

But that’s where making good investment decisions for yourself, ultimately is your responsibility. You’re the only person that’s going to be looking out for number one, more than anybody else, and you’ll never even know where somebody else’s opinion lands on that without doing the work to deduce what it is. Essentially, don’t make your decisions based on nothing other than somebody else’s advice or opinion.

But long term, fundamentals are undefeated. If you don’t understand that you don’t understand the stock market.
Comment by Kope_58: Routing shares I bought through a dark pool and then not impacting price, is for one a manipulation of my order. I didn’t intend for you to send it through a dark pool, and you did. For example 70% of SSTs shares went through a dark pool on Friday. Shares were traded off exchange. I certainly didn’t give permission for this. You manipulated my fucking order.

There’s immense controversy surrounding this subreddit, but this is a great detailed post answering your questions.
Comment by mublob: This is actively being investigated by the SEC, as per Gary Gensler's public communications. Internalization of orders and order fulfillment via dark pools inhibits price discovery where one side (for example the buy side) is disproportionately sent to dark pools while the other side (sell side) is sent to lit exchanges. This is how supply and demand in financial markets can be manipulated to influence the price of securities. Hope that helps.
Comment by mublob: Duplicate comment, disregard
Comment by Shrekworkwork: With options that they have the $ to roll over indefinitely until the tide turns in their favor. And they farm premium the whole time.
Comment by Spockies: Yeah that's all good and great until your internalizing methods reach a tipping point. Instead of buying the shares near the time of the customer's order, with the delayed hedging and the market goes against you, you suddenly have to make up an excuse to stop normal market mechanics, all because you wanted to skim the difference for more profit.

Just because it looks like a buyer always has a seller to match does not mean that you can always internalize orders on the MM level. These methods do have fail conditions and risk the stability of markets at large.

The way companies return value to shareholders matters a great deal for some companies and sectors. Consider ocean freight companies that are generating huge profits right now. Their dividend and buy back policies are a big determinant to there current stock price.
Comment by YT-AnArtAccount: That's what I'm thinking about. I got a 212 portfolio which im just gonna let be for 20 years or so, with some cash on it to buy dips. It only accepts pounds and for my work I go around quite a bit. So lots of currencies. Anyhow, hence why I want to build a long term portfolio with a broker that accepts multiple currencies (was planning on staying in the UK when i began) due to my age I want to take some risks and go value, while I also like the passive income idea from Dividend since i try to built the same thing with digital products and niche websites.

Comment by QuaintHeadspace: This is precisely my point and every trade becomes over crowded then it tanks. Everyone moving to commodities then the war is over then what? 1 report of lower inflation and growth will be back in vogue and the cycle continues. Its a case of getting ahead of what the market is trampling to move to after each cycle but trying not to be too early. 

For example I'm going to open short positions in shipping companies. I'm very fucking early for this trade so I will buy put leaps for leverage for 2024 but watch how quickly people cycle into this trade over 6 months or so and all of a sudden lots of media comes out and says shipping is dead but the prices of the companies have already dipped trapping shorts that try to rid the companies down but are too late.
Comment by CQME: > But I won't touch something with a TTM PE of <20 on principle, unless I knew it was a one time weird expense driving things down.

Ok, I'll assume that oil going negative is an example of one of your one time expenses, because man it was blood in the streets in 2020 in that sector.
Comment by doctorzaius6969: not everybody is capable of having a vast knowledge about financial markets, e.g. if my wife was an investment strategist with a CFA, why shouldn't I let her do the investment decisions and keep my stupid ass out of it?
Comment by GainsOnTheHorizon: I'll risk downvotes for one reply: when Hertz went bankrupt in 2020, newer investors "bought the dip" without understanding nearly all bankrupties wipe out stockholders.  So I shorted the stock and waited for the stock to fall again, which it did.

I only tried that because I saw something similar in a bankruptcy in 2020.  The stock lost -80% of it's value... then naive investors started buying, and I sold when that enthusiasm peaked, taking only a -60% loss.  I think too many newer investors don't realize how bad it is to hold or buy stocks in bankruptcy.

Two sides to every trade.
Comment by Shrekworkwork: Options strategies are  like craps strategies. Sorta :P

Fun fact: out of all casino games craps has the best odds for the gambler, as well as best comps. You don’t even need to know how to play craps you can literally just make the same basic bet the whole time or follow other players bets.

Comment by F1shB0wl816: You don’t need vast knowledge to know and understand that nobody is looking out for you, more than you’re capable of. That doesn’t mean you’ll always be right or they’re always wrong, but we value our time and effort in money. Nobody is doing it out of the kindness of their hearts in the majority of cases. 

And you’re also not going to have the same relationship with most other people in your life as you would your significant other. Ones success tends to be mutually beneficial and wanted between one another, the same can’t be said between you and Cramer, buffet or user whatever the hell. 

I think you’re thinking to hard about it. This doesn’t really apply to the typical, starter pack investment advice one would hopefully have came across a dozen times over before they even put money in. When you’re doing more than averaging into the market over the next lifetime, you need to think for you. No one person has ever been always right, or capitalized on every great play.
Comment by None: Idk why you’d be downvoted. This is trading and what people do. My comment was for growing wealth and it doesn’t apply to every single edge case of course.
Comment by arlalanzily: this is why I hate investors. your JOBS SALARY is SIX FIGURES if not 50k. JUST GO TO WORK. there’s your annual return rate bRo.
Comment by arlalanzily: $Nio , $HMHC . Both solid companies. Both only
Took 1-2 years to accumulate. The charts don’t lie. pure facts. No pump and dump, no biotech bs, no crypto. just pure, plain gains.
Comment by FastAssSister: I never said I disagree. I’m saying that market manipulation will never be responsible for poor investment returns. The market has DIRECTLY followed corporate profits in LOCKSTEP. It is undefeated. 

So yes, their inability to make money is absolutely from a lack of experience and/or an inability to value businesses.
Comment by FastAssSister: Lol I’ve been investing for 20 years. Only someone with zero success and experience would say what you said.
Comment by Preum: Go read it. 

I’m not going to share the source and then explain to you what it says.
Comment by CQME: I looked at "panic sellers" and "choice" was generally not the first thing that came to mind lol
Comment by Lexphalanx: Oh, I was referring to the house as the literal house. As in you have to do battle with the casino to try to win while the odds are stacked in their favor. In the stock market, some human person always wins
Comment by slbaaron: People refer to house edge in gambling with the particular meaning of their chances of *beating you*. You can't be on house's side and join the side with winning edge. But in stock / investments you can be. 

Technically, we didn't need to make that distinction. Day trading is more akin to playing poker. You are playing against other players, you can definitely have the winning edge even in a casino if you are a high tier poker player. Alternatively, counting cards in black jack can consistently push you over to the winning edge too, but is largely combatted by high number of decks and early shuffles today.
Comment by shortyafter: Unless market sentiment turns bearish and people pull out of stocks for an extended period of time.  Then you want dividends.
Comment by NastyMonkeyKing: Ayyo the real answer. And with no upvotes shocker.

Professionals will evaluate discounted cash flows and enterprise value. The rest is just derivative
Comment by GainsOnTheHorizon: Dictionary is a noun, not a verb.  Try again.
Comment by Newbie4Hire: was it?  You must have made a killing then.
Comment by hatetheproject: It’s obvious in hindsight. But please, tell me which companies it’s *glaringly obvious* will go down from here, mr hindsight. 

And that doesn’t even nullify his point anyway! He wasn’t saying it was obvious, all he was saying that the market was either overvalued at the top or undervalued at the bottom, which it seems you agree with.
Comment by hatetheproject: And yet tesla is back up most of the way. The market is irrational at certain times, whether that was then or whether it’s now. Case closed.
Comment by CQME: If you believe I'm upset that's because you have confirmation bias.
Comment by Warzeal: Dude stop lol. You are twisting words just trying to sound philosophical.
Comment by None: [deleted]
Comment by Preum: “Never responsible” is too exaggerated, although sure I see your point.
Comment by Current-Information7: I see you spend a lot of time on sub r/survivinginfidelity

I would like to take this time to Congratulate you, sincerely. Im impressed at how you reason, develop arguments to support your position — and ultimately were able to be in a relationship with another human for _any_ length of time. I mean, before you realized they _bounced_

Consider taking up a volunteering job, there are many in your community, take care
Comment by Calm_Leek_1362: You don't need margin to panic. Hell, some people panic when a position goes down 10%.
Comment by CathieWoodsStepChild: The literal house is the brokerage, they either take a commission or PFOF.
Comment by UdntNeed2C: Made out pretty decent yeah.
Comment by UdntNeed2C: That’s hilarious 😂
Comment by F1shB0wl816: When did “you’re the only one ultimately looking out for your own financial success” suddenly become philosophical? Talk about twisting words while their seems to be an issue with getting that straight.
Comment by arlalanzily: the stock market is a casino. Plain and simple. The literal days and weeks of hours you spend on DD should be spent on your own business. Not some rich guys company or index you think will be a safe store for your cash. I’m not shitting on anyone. I’m just being a degenerate gambler just like EVERYONE ELSE on r/stocks. Only difference is that I’m SELF AWARE.
Comment by MarcosaurusRex: Maybe that ass wasn’t fat enough?
Comment by CQME: >  some people panic when a position goes down 10%.

lol...
Comment by Lexphalanx: An entity making a little bit of money on every trade does not qualify them as the house, that would be closer to again the federal government taking the ante of a casino table game. A house entity I would expect to be able and likely to actually beat you and cause you to lose.
Comment by Newbie4Hire: The way you are talking, should have made out with at least 2000% increase.  If it was so glaringly obvious, you should have traded options on it and 20x your money on the conservative end.  Hell with the way you sound, 1000x seems like it should have been on the table.  Coulda grabbed some way otm puts on FB for a penny a piece and turned $1000 into $1,000,000  easy, zero risk.    I'm guessing that didn't happen though.
Comment by doctorzaius6969: If you think you can not trust your wife/husband or other close family members who have more knowledge about investing, you have serious trust issues. Billionaires have their investment experts taking care of their money and rich families have their family offices.
Comment by Current-Information7: 😂
Comment by FastAssSister: Awww, you guys can’t read or spell. That’s cute.
Comment by UdntNeed2C: Probably could have, but I avoid options etc and anytime I do play with them it’s for minimal amounts. I did however sell all of my shares before the drop so made out pretty decent
Comment by F1shB0wl816: Where did I say one couldn’t? I pointed out that that relationship is clearly an exception, or are you unable to distinguish the difference between your significant other and every other joe who comes along?

And I also told you you’re thinking about it too hard, you just want to argue. In you’re own example, each example is somebody who came to their OWN conclusion on what’s best to do with their money. That doesn’t mean either of those choices made are inherently good, you’re pretending as if your examples are excluded from another’s bad decision impacting them. Some billionaires also thought it was sound advice to listen to madoff, what’s your point? 

People have others manage money all the time. “Smart” people with contradictory opinions and outlooks across all of investments. Are you really going to say there’s a one size fits all strategy for investing? What works for one, doesn’t for another. That’s where you need to come to your own conclusions, otherwise you’re going to eat more risk than you’re comfortable with, negatively impacting the emotions. Or you’re going to leave money on the table because of the any day now crash of everyday. There’s no way blindly listening  to somebody pays off, unless it’s in their benefit, like when it’s their job.
Title : CarBuzz: Volkswagen Refuses To Let A Crisis Go To Waste (VOW, VWAGY)
[Volkswagen Refuses To Let A Crisis Go To Waste](https://carbuzz.com/news/volkswagen-refuses-to-let-a-crisis-go-to-waste)

Intro:

> The global semiconductor chip shortage crisis has struck Volkswagen USA. The automaker has just confirmed that production at its massive Chattanooga, Tennessee factory will shut down for two weeks starting on June 7.

Excerpt:

> But VW isn't about to let a crisis go to waste. Instead of letting dust collect on the plant's machinery and many workers being sent home, upgrades will take place on the assembly line focusing on quality improvements and other related areas.

> In addition, workers will continue training and preparation to build the ID.4 all-electric crossover. At present, the ID.4 is only built alongside its ID.3 hatchback sibling at VW's Zwickau plant in Germany. That means all ID.4s on the road in America right now are imported, but this won't last for long.

And:

> VW is adding a state-of-the-art high-voltage laboratory designed specifically to develop and test EV cells and battery packs.Comment by HyggeEnabler: Im sorry, but isnt this completely normal for production and manufacturing? That whenever you have some known downtime, you will do all of this.

Many companies have long lists of things ready to be done whenever they have a planned pause in production or when something like this occurs
Comment by BOOGIEMAN-219: So are they going to make more money or what?
Comment by Stealth3S3: This is normal.
Comment by Ehralur: Yep. This is not news. It would've been news if VW DID let a crisis go to waste, as that would've been highly unusual and inefficient.
Comment by Torlek1: This is not a planned pause.  Getting stuff ready for a new product happens during pauses that are planned.
Comment by marcuscontagius: Exactly, thank you
Comment by matttchew: Ya, little do those workers know, there will be a nice machine taking over some of their jobs lol.
Comment by Inquisitor1: Since they aren't going to make money they are gonna do things you usually want to do but don't do that reduce making money. Shutting things down to repair them, etc.
Title : Financial Times: Volkswagen's electric vehicles not affected by semiconductor shortage (VOW, VWAGY)
[VW's electric cars spared in chip crisis](https://www.ft.com/content/19245515-5482-48a4-85bd-17844ce98d3b)

Excerpt:

> The rollout of Volkswagen’s flagship electric cars has been unaffected by the semiconductor shortages roiling the industry, easing investor concerns that bottlenecks would leave the company unable to meet strict EU emissions targets.

Also:

> But the brand’s chief executive, Ralf Brandstätter, told the Financial Times the chips crisis had so far only hit combustion engine models such as the Passat.

> “At the moment it is not influencing our [CO2] target,” he said, referring to the annual EU standards with which VW must comply or face heavy fines. However, he added that the company’s entire chip supply chain remained volatile.

And:

> The wider Volkswagen group, which includes Audi, Porsche and Seat, is heavily reliant on the success of VW’s new ID.3 and ID.4 electric vehicles to counterbalance combustion-engine sales in Europe.Comment by ScottyStellar: Got lucky selling my poahy at the peak around 11.50, may buy in again soon after this dip
Comment by Dowdell2008: I just got into POAHY at $10.5 and VWAPY under $26.
Comment by Torlek1: Translation: The Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, remains on schedule to catch up to and overtake Tesla.
Comment by SparkyFrog: No sales, no problems
Comment by misterspatial: I see Volkswagen is projecting false impressions again.

They can't even get the Bluetooth and rear-view camera to work in my Jetta.
Comment by Torlek1: They already delivered 59,900 BEVs in Q1.
Comment by SparkyFrog: Their total car sales in 2020 were down 15. 2% vs. Toyota's 11.3% tho. But yeah, just a joke, of course they want to keep their EV lines running.
Comment by Torlek1: If it were any other legacy auto maker, said company would choose to keep pumping ICE vehicles this year and slash BEV production.
Comment by yangminded: No. You wanna know why?

Fleet emission targets.

Focusing on ICE vehicles and reducing BEVs would be a sure way to commit financial sudoku - especially for a company like Volkswagen who have a large share in Europe.
Comment by Torlek1: The likes of Daimler, BMW, Renault, etc. are absolutely licking their chops at the chip shortage.  This is their excuse to slash BEV production this year and double down on ICE vehicles, emission targets be damned.

"There's always next year!" - until there isn't.

VW knows this.  The others don't.
Title : How ICLN Holdings have changed (As of April 19)
ICLN holdings have changed quite a bit, with quite a lot of stocks being added to the mix. The table below is quite large, so here's a link for anyone that would like to download and view the table from their own desktop:
https://1drv.ms/x/s!AvenkqTxBF38hHgxU34JaWNAK1kw?e=0UgB0y

I'll list some of what I believe to be the big changes for those who don't want to spend time looking through the chart:
- NZD Cash accounts for 7.7% of the weight, which may imply holdings will be increased, or more stocks are yet to be bought.
- New holdings ENEL, NEE and XCEL now account for about 13.4% of ICLN.
- Verbund AG, closely followed by Meridian Energy took the biggest hits, having 3,000,000 ($222,767,000) and 50,100,000($195,255,000) sold
- PLUG had it's holding decreased by 4,000,000 shares, reducing the total weighting to 3.55%
- Notable additions, in my opinion are BLDP and FCEL (I have a bias for hydrogen fuel cells/hydrogen in general)

Comment by Hairy-Ad-8947: Finally, I may actually cost avg down now, avg cost 33.47...ugh
Comment by everybodysaysso: This makes me happy. Finally that expense ratio is coming to use. Glad PLUG % went down and NEE is in. Vestas is solid too.
Comment by ysharm10: Thanks for this, OP!

Although I'll research but does anyone know anything about Vestas?
Comment by None: I’m thinking 🤔 of adding another 100 shares
Comment by None: Thank God they finally came to their senses
Comment by Typhoon4444: Thank god they've finally given wind power a fair shake!
Comment by Redtyde: Hopefully people will now stop talking about this like PLUG is the only thing in it.
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: I'm bullish on PLUG long term, but I think it's smart to put focus towards companies that have proved that they can show results with positive net income at this stage. NEE releases their earnings tomorrow. I don't think poor earnings will do much damage, but good earnings may push ICLN up quite a bit. The stock has been rallying for quite a while now, which makes me think there may be a positive earnings whisper going their way
Comment by None: Exactly my thoughts
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: Here's what I can give you, straight from tradingview:

Vestas Wind Systems A/S engages in the development, manufacture, sale, and maintenance of wind power plants. It operates through the Power Solutions and Service segments. The Power Solutions segment comprises the sale of wind power plants and wind turbines. The Service segment includes the sale of service contracts, spare parts, and related activities. The company was founded by Smith Hansen and Peder Hansen in 1945 and is headquartered in Aarhus, Denmark.

They look like a solid company. P/E of 40, which I would argue is slightly undervalued. A very established company with a $250 billion market cap. They've increased YOY revenue over the past 3 years, pulling in a revenue of $110 billion. It'd be interesting to know whether they have a monopoly on Wind Power plants though.

Edit: These numbers may actually be in Danish Kronens, which would translate to a $40 billion market cap and $17.8 billion in revenue. Far from monopoly level, but incredible numbers nonetheless
Comment by maejsh: Its a huge company, one of if not the biggest on wind. Had a good run up. Has a stock split in a few days too. Its a good bet, have both iqqh/icln and a few vestas shares myself
Comment by Actual-Ad-7209: How so? Nothing changed. They're just tracking the [index](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/esg/sp-global-clean-energy-index/#overview), same as always.
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: The index changed. Holdings were increased from 30, they will supposedly increase to 100, which means that there's probably some more stocks to be added
Comment by Actual-Ad-7209: I'm fully aware. The fund management however changed nothing. They're just continuing to track the index.
Comment by None: Ok so the index changed. Same thing here lmfao
Title : ICLN rebalances update: PLUG down to just 3.7%
Here are the new top holdings as of April 16th. Do you think this will stabilize this ETF? I sure do.

VWS:VESTAS WIND SYSTEMS 7.92%

NZD:NZD CASH	7.54% 

ORSTED:ORSTED 6.45%

SEDG: SOLAREDGE TECHNOLOGIES INC 3.65%Comment by None: I’m holding bigly $ICLN
Comment by nightmanvsunshine: Well for those of u pissed about plug in ICLN: 

1. Financial miscalculations of plug are scary 
2. Buy plug on sale now if u want bigger positions
Comment by Isunova: Finally, thank the fucking lord. $ICLN has been languishing the last few months. They were way too heavy into $PLUG and I’m glad they trimmed their position. 

I don’t think hydrogen fuel cells are the future, or even have a future. They will NEVER replace lithium-ion battery tech. Plug was always a pipe dream. It is far too inconvenient.

Edit: 7% in NZD?? I need an explanation for this 🤔🤔
Comment by StochasticDecay: It's market cap weighted....
Comment by SanFranJon: UnPlugged finally!
Comment by coolcomfort123: nice, this is going back to $30.
Comment by maejsh: Vestas doing a stock split on the 27th iirc. 
Might be a good time to buy in..
Comment by wolfmmos: Wait so let me get this right as a new zealander I am now paying a conversation rate to reinvest back into my own cash
Comment by Cpt_Random: What about IQQH? It's it also going to be rebalanced as ICLN? Right now it still has PLUG as 1st holding and I don't like it.

EDIT: ok, checked again and it's the same as ICLN - as it should be.
Comment by ddroukas: Is there a full list available? Wondering if my PCG calls will be nuked.
Comment by BotDadGamer1: Are they still rebalancing or is it over?
Comment by Ifrezznew: NZD? As in New Zealand Dollars? 
Anyone got a explanation for this lol?
Comment by None: Was NEE in it before? I thought it wasn't included.
Comment by Typhoon4444: Finally I can buy some more of this ETF. The Plug mess previously was frustrating.
Comment by stickykk: I hope so, if I wanted to invest in plug I would have directly bought stock.
Comment by NiknameOne: PLUG was overvalued but the whole sector was, don’t blame the Crash on PLUG alone.

Solar stocks dropped just as much. Im still not a fan of hydrogen stocks.
Comment by VictorDanville: Antimatter energy will come before hydrogen energy
Comment by Radman41: Uh oh... Bought two week put on plug at Fridays close. I hope sell-off continue.
Comment by Harambe_Like_Baby: So is this why plug has been getting fucked
Comment by Wynslo: I'm laughing at this because the only one worth investigating in is plug. That should be 100% of the etf
Comment by elgigantedelsur: Love the NZD cash. Our whole country is just made of clean energy (presumably it’s actually MEL sales)
Comment by None: Doesn't this just mean that people who caught the downside now won't get the upside of plug? it seems okay if the correction left you break even or above but other than that would it not be better to hold? I've been so confused by why this rebalance is such a good thing
Comment by TODO_getLife: Very happy there's not such a big reliance on PLUG.
Comment by Shaun8030: Still too much plug , dump the turd
Comment by jackietsaah: Same here, balls deep in leaps, bleeding red 😂
Comment by 8an5: Plug won’t be profitable for a long time
Comment by MrAndre44: I work in the hydrogen industry. People making it about "either lithium or hydrogen" are making a wrong assumption. Both have their use cases. Hydrogen in short to medium range vehicles does not make sense and this area will probably be occupied by lithium.

Medium to heavy duty vehicles such as trucks, buses and ships need a fast refuelling system and a much larger energy storage than lithium based batteries can provide while being weight efficient. Herefore they are going to be using hydrogen in the future.

Therefore both technologies have their place.
Comment by wilan727: I think the nzd cash is the selling of contact and meridian energy shares on the nzx
Comment by hardreset20: I think that’s what they said about nuclear power too. Now it’s the standard Naval propulsion system.
Comment by None: It’ll probably work in long haul trucks better than batteries (less weight and none of the range issues that batteries have) but it won’t be in normal cars.
Comment by dmead: > It is far too inconvenient.

how is refueling your car the same way people are used to with gasoline inconvenient?
Comment by IHBC: I can see hydrogen being used in planes. Some argue it’s safer than diesel. It has 3X energy density and its lighter so it decreases fuel usage and overall plane weight. A win win. 

And last but not least, with planes refueling and being grounded in concentrated locations (airports) we won’t need to build millions of hydrogen power stations around the world. Only thousands at airports. I looked it up and there are approximately 17,000 public airports worldwide and 5,000 in the USA
Comment by nate94gt: Hydrogen is 100% the future. The electric vehicles we have now are not the answer but are a stop gap between gas and hydrogen.
Comment by Megahuts: Also, hydrogen has the problem of being really hard to contain, and extremely flammable.

Every car would basically be a rolling bomb.
Comment by elgigantedelsur: Our money is made of hydrogen, obviously
Comment by scarface910: "PLUG up 25%"

"Guys ICLN bought more PLUG!"
Comment by DunkingTea: Ah I wish...
Comment by pWheff: Presumably that $$$ is from sales on the NZX so it isn't converted in that direction.  If BR goes outside NZX to spend it then you'll pay that forward conversion I suppose but I assume BR gets attractive rates (from themselves?)...
Comment by Bayz0r: It's the same fund, just different tickers for different exchanges.
Comment by EchoooEchooEcho: I dont think its done they have 7% in new zealand dollars lol
Comment by No_Sanity: They sold a bunch of Meridian and Contact Energy which trades on the NZX
Comment by Immerdurstig: No, it was definitely not in the ETF this time last year and is the reason I didn't buy.
Comment by OystersClamsCuckolds: Hydrogen is already a thing.
Comment by JRshoe1997: Plug has been getting fucked for almost two months now
Comment by deezalmonds998: >investigating in

Hmm
Comment by testestestestest555: Ever. It's a fraud company.
Comment by jad4400: Not in the industry, but from what white papers/educational material I've had access to, I agree 100%. Hydrogen's strength seems to be in the heavier industries/large vehicle category rather than short range vehicles. Its going to be real fascinating to see where it goes!
Comment by jhansonxi: How does it compare to CNG?  I worked at a company back in the 90s that was doing small fleet conversions.  Seems like CNG would be cheaper and the infrastructure mostly already exists.
Comment by prophecynotrequired: Lets hope they pick a good time to spend their cash.
Comment by jarl-sam: To be fair, navy has been using nuclear power since the 60s
Comment by Muboi: The standard Naval propulsion system is different forms of oil lol
Comment by KyivComrade: And yet we don't see cars/busses/airplanes or even spaceships with nuclear engines. Nuclear had its uses, especially for long term/low maintenance engines. What does hydro have?
Comment by Ka07iiC: It is the energy requirement to produce Hydrogen Fuel. Electric can be generated with renewable energy which can ultimately be used to generate Hydrogen, but why not just use it to charge electric batteries?

I am by no means an expert on Hydrogen Fuel vs Li batteries.
Comment by NiknameOne: It’s highly explosive and more importantly not energy efficient. Best case scenario, based on what I researched, hydrogen will reach 50% energy efficiency compared to batteries.
Comment by mustang_67_2k8: Planes don’t use diesel
Comment by None: Wow that's the first time I saw someone claimed hydrogen has better energy density than fossil fuels ...

And literally nobody argues that hydrogen is safer than diesel neither. Well know it's more dangerous. A high pressure and it burns as soon as it come in contact with air vs diesel where I can throw a burning matchstick into and it won't burn.
Comment by Tripoloski040: Haha sorry but there is so much wrong here i dont know where to start.
Comment by Habib_Marwuana: Are you sure about that? Hydrogen is extremely inefficient to produce. I think it may work for planes and trucks but not for standard vehicles.
Comment by FinndBors: Okay, this is obviously a biased source, but Elon Musk lays it out pretty clearly in a 2 minute Q&A section in 2016 how useless hydrogen is for cars:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFPnT-DCBVs
Comment by venomous_frost: If it were, I think the investment horizon is too long anyway. If hydrogen takes another 30 years to break through, i'll be retired
Comment by RowanHarley: This is a common misconception. Some actually argue that hydrogen is safer than hydrocarbon fuels. Don't take it from me though, here's an engineer that works with hydrogen:
https://hydrogen.wsu.edu/2017/03/17/so-just-how-dangerous-is-hydrogen-fuel/
Comment by ex_planelegs: Rolling bomb is a good description of a car with a massive lithium ion battery in it
Comment by desquibnt: What do you think they are now?
Comment by Ifrezznew: Makes sense thanks
Comment by TODO_getLife: I wonder if they will rebalance again with that cash
Comment by None: I bought NEE separately because I was pretty sure it wasn't in ICLN. Guess I can ditch my holding in NEE now.
Comment by Wynslo: I see lol
Comment by MrAndre44: CNG or even LNG (even more compressed and therefore liquid natural gas) is a fossil fuel. It has a high energy density and is preferable to conventional fuel but hydrogen can be produced using renewable energy. Since renewable energy is not a steady energy source but has peaks in production (imagine a sunny day with a lot of wind) which might be higher than the current energy demand (imagine this sunny day being a sunday when there is not a lot of production) this excess energy can then be used to produce hydrogen whithout producing carbon dioxide (this is called green hydrogen). Therefore hydrogen is a way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in transportation.
Comment by hardreset20: Unless your talking about ships and subs.
Comment by hardreset20: Exactly.
Comment by KingofCraigland: Busses and trains could run on hydrogen fuel cells.
Comment by hardreset20: Yeah, it’s not practice for everything.
Comment by hardreset20: Bill Gates wants to build little nuclear sub-stations all over to charge your EV cars.
Comment by mustang_67_2k8: You don’t see cara busses airplanes or spaceships using nuclear engines because no single government would allow mini nukes on the road or flying around in the air. That’s why the navy uses it and train people specifically how to maintain it. Imagine a mild car accident causing a small nuclear explosion..... come on
Comment by None: Problem is that batteries are very heavy. They are fine for cars and trucks, which are used to being heavy and having suspensions. 

Ships and planes need to be light though, which is where hydrogen comes in nicely. You can get a ton of energy into a hydrogen cell ship, and without the weight of dense batteries. Same with planes. Plus, batteries need to get away from limited resources just like fuel cells do. 

I think we will likely see a mix, with hydrogen fuels dominating shipping and batteries in consumer cars/ public transportation. Neither one can solve the problem alone. Invest in both!
Comment by dmead: I get what you're saying but I'm super skeptical given what just happened over the weekend with that tesla crash.
Comment by None: Batteries are highly explosive, gasoline is highly explosive...

Comment by brubakerp: > Planes don’t use diesel

JET-A is basically Kerosene or Diesel #1.  They are extremely similar.

https://generalaviationnews.com/2011/03/17/jet-a-versus-diesel-fuel/
Comment by Veranova: Production efficiency is a problem to be solved, not really a physical wall like the energy density of batteries is close to. Plus we have a problem with renewable storage, so who cares if the xx% of solar energy which will be wasted entirely on a hot day ends up going toward an inefficient capture mechanism?

I’m also a sceptic of hydrogen in _everything_, but it has a lot of valid uses.
Comment by None: Not going to name companies so it doesn't seem like a shill, but some have come up with basically "solar panels" that separate water efficiently enough to be cost effective. Storage is the real issue, *especially* on a consumer level.
Comment by Megahuts: Thanks for sharing!

Definitely sounds safer outdoors, though they do mention a hydrogen leak would be dangerous in an enclosed space like a garage.
Comment by Kiss_It_Goodbyeee: Exactly! Hydrogen doesn't puddle like petrol/gasoline does either. It simply evaporates.
Comment by Megahuts: Gasoline needs to vaporize before it can combust.

You can put your cigarette out in diesel. 

Hydrogen is already a gas, and would need to be under very high pressure to get the density you need. And, it is extremely hard to actually keep contained (being just two protons will do that).

Also, you don't use gas of diesel for welding, but you can use hydrogen:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_hydrogen_welding

So, no, hydrogen fuel cells are incredibly impractical.
Comment by No_Sanity: I'm sure they would move it make into USD to buy something else. No way they will hold that much in NZD or even anything they would want to spend that much on in the NZX
Comment by ChiefInternetSurfer: Unless you’re talking about ~~ships~~ *carriers* and subs.
Comment by Muboi: Are you high do you think cargo ships have nuclear reactors?
There are literally less than 20 ships in the world with nuclear propulsion and a big chunk of subs still runs on diesel.
Comment by Habib_Marwuana: Yeah what’s interesting about these substations is that if something goes wrong (ie power loss) they collapse on themselves and smother the core.
Comment by nightmanvsunshine: Terrorism much?
Comment by Veranova: Electric has the same problem in trucking. They have a legal max weight on roads and batteries take up a huge chunk of a truck’s weight which impacts margins. Tesla’s truck might be useful for short-haul, but I see a hybrid system like HYLN (with gas or hydrogen) being the future for long-haul.
Comment by Standard_Mather: Don't forget industrial processes! Steel making, boilers etc. Probably less relevant too PLUG.
Comment by NiknameOne: This is due to autonomous driving, which would affect hydrogen cars too. And it’s an overreaction, since autonomous is actually a lot safer if you calculate accidents per 100km driven.

And I’m more worried about the higher costs per km (mile) of Hydrogen. It has niche applications though.

Lastly, margins seem to be very slim and not improving.
Comment by NiknameOne: Absolutely. But it’s more controllable than pressurized hydrogen. Anyway it’s not my main concern. 

Costs are the biggest problem!
Comment by mustang_67_2k8: Good article, that points out 
“So has the aero diesel’s time finally arrived? Outside North America, turbocharged diesel aircraft engines are in high demand, and that trend will only accelerate. Here in the United States, there is a growing fascination with diesels, but it’s too soon to say”
I will concede that it exists and I failed to include small aircraft in my original statement. However it’s an emerging market not a world wide norm. Nor is it found in large capacity with airlines. Airports aren’t going to spend millions to service a bunch of Cessna’s with a 39 gal tank because it uses diesel when the airliner comes in and needs 6,875 gallons of Jet-A. 

I also don’t know of a single turbine engine that runs diesel, but I’m not an expert on every engine out there and am willing to concede, also, that it’s possible there is one.
Comment by mustang_67_2k8: But it’s not the same thing, not 100% or it would be called the same thing. You can use it in either, diesel in a jet-a or vis-versa. However it can damage the engine over time. And I garuntee you, if you put diesel in a plane that isn’t meant specifically for diesel and it crashes, the investigation the FAA does will land you in the hot seat. They aren’t going to just accept “well it’s kinda like, basically the same thing”
Comment by RowanHarley: Ya, sure, I don't think it's safe enough yet, but I also don't think we're as far away from a hydrogen future as many think. I have my bets on APD. They'll do well without more hydrogen usage, but even better if hydrogen does take its place in the likes of transport
Comment by Standard_Mather: This
Comment by 8an5: Are you saying bill gates is a terrorist or that nuclear substations would be a target for terrorists?
Comment by brubakerp: Your typical Cessnas use avfuel/avgas, which is gasoline that's about 100 octane.  Very different from Diesel/JET-A.
Comment by nightmanvsunshine: Ah now I get the down votes. 

I’m saying nuclear substations would be a target. Bill gates is not a terrorist. Him and his wife do a lot of good for the world.
Comment by mustang_67_2k8: ........ so, since avgas is not diesel or jet-a (no / cause they aren’t same). I feel like you’re just arguing to argue. 🤷🏼‍♂️
Comment by ilikemyusername1: I understood what you meant. 
I gave an upvote, it’s not much but I hope it helps.
Title : What's changed with ICLN Holdings (April 12th)
Noticed that some changes were made to ICLN holdings just now, and thought I'd post the differences, since I was surprised with some of the changes. I will point out that only 2 new stocks seems to have been added (ENLT, REGI), I think this rebalancing isn't until 16th April. However, here are the interesting changes to be noted, for those who don't want to spend time looking through the table:

- 40,000 more shares of PLUG were bought, bringing their total holding to just over 12 million shares
- 1 million shares of Meridian Energy were sold, bringing the total shares held to 60 million
- 400,000 shares of Xinyl Solar were bought
- 800,000 shares of Contact Energy were sold
- 612,000 shares of NEOEN shares were bought
- 16,000,000 shares of Enlight Renewable Energy Ltd were bought
- 1,408,000 shares of Renewable Energy Inc were bought
I might be wrong on the 2 stocks which were added, they may have already been in ICLN, but I they weren't on my excel sheet
Table for those interested:

Comment by gainlong: Thank you for posting this detailed list of ICLN holdings.

Saving this for later.
Comment by coolcomfort123: Back to $30 any time soon?
Comment by GrapeJuicex: I commented last time, but are we thinking April 16th is the big day for rebalancing? When it drastically increases its holdings?
Comment by MassHugeAtom: Xinyl solar is a good stock.
Comment by Shaun8030: They increased plug lol thank goodness I got out with a gain .
Comment by Qs9bxNKZ: Noticed no TSLA in that mix.  If it did, it would have been up considering the run that TSLA has gone through.  

As such, I'd probably (if I want TSLA exposure) QCLN
Comment by desquibnt: ICLN just tracks the S&P Global Clean Energy index. 

S&P publishes their methodology in creation of the index

https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-thematic-indices.pdf

The explanation starts on page 9
Comment by futureIsYes: It's more than 50% down since the highs of jan/feb. Why sell at such a loss? Unless PLUG is going down the drain, I think they are doing the right thing!
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: If I had to guess, I'd say they know something we don't. Although there's no doubt that they will be profitable in the next 5 years, the question is why are they buying now? I've seen some rumours going around that the restatement doesn't affect revenue numbers, and with Blackrock having bought 300,000 shares only a week or so ago as well, it makes me more confident that these rumours very well might be correct. I hold 100 shares of PLUG, but I've been selling ITM covered calls and rolling down as they get close to the money, and it's hedged my losses pretty well, but the next few weeks will be very shaky for PLUG
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: No problem. I like to keep a track of how it changes for myself anyways, I said I might as well post it here so that others can share their thoughts, or speculate on why changes were made
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: Depends on what time you'd consider soon. I think we will break 30 again this year, its just a matter of when I think. Once PLUG clears up its accounting issues, if it turns out there was no big changes from original numbers, it may spark another bull run for clean energy. If not, it'll most likely be slow gains to 30 by EOY. Clean energy isn't going anywhere anytime soon, its definitely a good long term bet.
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: I'm pretty sure there was an article, but that was the date it mentioned. What I would say is check IShares page for ICLN, they show the holdings. If its dated April 16th and you see a lot more than 30 holdings, its probably been rebalanced, but I'll probably make another post about it if I remember
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: It has been doing pretty well. I stay away from it because it's chinese listed, but it was on a pretty bullish run last time I checked
Comment by animaldoggie: A lot of people have enough TSLA in ARK holdings, it made ICLN an attractive alternative.
Comment by Shaun8030: Plug is so shit though
Comment by desquibnt: ICLN is an index fund not an active ETF like the ARK funds. All indices are based on empirical data which means if there's a holding in an index fund, it's not because the fund manager is bullish on the company - it's because it fit the criteria to be included.
Comment by gainlong: I'm not a big fan of ETF's but I do own ICLN and am curious to see what exactly they all hold. Thank you for your work.
Comment by DoctorQuinlan: So you are bullish on icln as a whole? I’ve lost a good amount on icln. Don’t have strictly plug. I’m wondering if I should just dollar cost average down or hold for now.
Comment by EchoooEchooEcho: Its April 16 after market closes, so any changes would be seen on Monday or later
Comment by GrapeJuicex: Thanks! Yeah, i'll check it out as well.
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: Straight from the Prospectus:

"As investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for thegeneral management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investmentprogram for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managingthe Fund, BFA may draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management
affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund’sinvestment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategistsand other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplinesand leverages BFA’s extensive resources.Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered
into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of theFund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred withrespect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution ofportfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses,litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the
Trustees who are not “interested persons” of the Trust). As of March 31, 2020, for its investment advisory services to the Fund, BFA was paid a
management fee from the Fund corresponding to the Fund’s allocable portion of anaggregate management fee calculated based on the aggregate average daily net assetsof the following iShares funds: ..., iShares Global Clean Energy ETF,..."

Interpret this as you will, but it seems to me that it is, at the very least, similar to an actively managed fund.
Comment by lance-: It doesn't show rebalancing but [ETFdb](https://etfdb.com/etf/ICLN/) is usually pretty up to date on holdings.
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: Do what you think is best. I might believe in Plug, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm right. If you believe in PLUG, or even ICLN, then maybe you should consider DCA down, if not, you should probably just hold
Comment by desquibnt: Here's another copy and paste from the ICLN prospectus: 

> The Fund seeks to track the investment
results of the S&P Global Clean Energy
IndexTM (the “Underlying Index”), which
is designed to track the performance of

Title : Oops. DD underestimated Volkswagen by 2025. Could be a Ten-Bagger worth at least $1.9 Trillion USD, not $1.1 Trillion USD (VOW and VWAGY)
Previous DD grossly underestimated the worth of Volkswagen by 2025.  It could be at least $1.9 trillion USD, not just $1.1 trillion USD.

[VOW is the actual European stock ticker. VWAGY is for American depository receipt equivalents at one-tenth of VOW.  Meanwhile, PAH3 is the actual European stock ticker for parent company Porsche, while POAHY is for the American depository receipt equivalents at one-tenth of PAH3.]

**Value Play**

I can't provide the link to the article, but it is titled "Volkswagen Is Undervalued And Is Perfectly Positioned For A Cyclical Upturn," written by "The Value Analyst."

I'll quote this part, though:

> Price to Sales remains at 0.66 and P/E remain at 10. For a company whose long-term growth potential is around 5-6% this stock is modestly priced. Although with similar growth rates many similar stocks trade at a much higher level. Cash flow tends to be a lot more volatile for VW and quite often in the negative due to capital expenditures. In general cash flow is not a good metric for vehicle manufacturers. The current ratio remains around 1.15, and that's quite good for a car maker.

> Overall, the state of finances remains solid, and there is certainly some value in the stock. A conservative DCF that assumes 8% WACC and 5% growth, with a terminal rate of 0%, shows the stock is likely valued at around $42.

Where I differ with that author, of course, is my position that a PT of $42 for VWAGY should apply *only* to Volkswagen's ICE and hybrid businesses.  Of the total auto sales of 9,305,400 units and €222.9 billion, the PT of $42 should apply *only* to 9,073,800 units and sales growth therein.

Furthermore, a slight discount could be applied if VW spins off its Porsche brands as a separate company to raise funds.  The company sold 272,200 Porsche units in 2020, so Volkswagen's ICE and hybrid sales less these amounted to 8,801,600 units.  An adjusted PT of $40 would be appropriate than what was suggested in previous DD.

An adjusted PT of $40 means that the ICE and hybrid businesses minus Porsche should be worth €172.6 billion.

**Next Tesla Play**

Forget value investing.  Forget problems with being asset-heavy instead of being asset-light (i.e., as opposed to richly valued growth stories in the tech sector).

We want the next bubble play!  We want the Next Tesla!  We want tech valuations!  We want price-to-sales valuations!

[As of March 19, Tesla's price-to-sales ratio is 22.04.](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/tsla/tesla/price-sales)

Thus, let's scrutinize the 231,600 EV unit sales for 2020 and [Volkswagen's goal to become the consumer EV market leader by 2025](https://www.barrons.com/articles/this-is-how-long-it-takes-to-become-an-ev-player-51616075163).

The biggest non-Tesla pure play in the consumer EV space, NIO, sold over 43,700 units in 2020 for a [gross margin of 11.5%](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-reports-unaudited-fourth-quarter-and-full-1).  As of March 19, its price-to-sales multiple is higher than Tesla's, at 26.60, despite not having the latter's cutting-edge battery technology or autonomous driving technology.

Not far behind are Li Auto and Xpeng, which sold approximately 30,000 units and 27,000 units in 2020, respectively.  Their respective gross margins were [16.4%](https://kr-asia.com/ev-maker-li-auto-generates-strong-profits-as-deliveries-surge) and [4.6%](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210308005328/en/XPeng-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2020-Unaudited-Financial-Results).  They trade at similar price-to-sales multiples despite lacking Tesla's cutting-edge battery technology or autonomous driving technology.

Even when combined, these claimants to "second mover advantage" sold far less consumer EV units than 231,600 units.  It is clear here that the real second mover is Volkswagen, not these pretenders.

Without further information, a *minimum* monetary estimate of Volkswagen EV revenues in 2020 is €5.55 billion: €222.9 billion in total revenue x 231,600 EV unit sales / 9,305,400 total unit sales.  Since EVs are currently more expensive than less clean vehicles, their EV revenues should be noticeably greater.

Every bubble play has a price-to-sales multiple of at least 20.  Therefore, the consumer EV business of the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, *should have already been worth at least €111.0 billion last year*.  [Deutsche Bank has recently stated that this particular business should already be worth €195.0 billion.](https://fortune.com/2021/03/22/volkswagen-vw-db-report-ev-business-tesla/)  However, this is a conservative estimate, as the company has beaten its earlier EV unit sales targets, and again because EV are currently more expensive than less clean vehicles.

How much further should this EV-related market cap "stonk"?

Well, [Volkswagen plans to sell at least 450,000 all-electric vehicles this very year.](https://www.carscoops.com/2021/03/volkswagen-shares-soar-on-the-back-of-ambitious-ev-targets/)  If this is realistic, then the consumer EV sales could reach €10.78 billion.  Accordingly, the consumer EV business could be worth up to €215.6 billion, not €195.0 billion.

**Grossly Undervalued Like Yesterday**

As of March 19, VWAGY closed at a mere $34.15; Volkswagen's entire business has been valued at a mere €147.4 billion.  The upside to $40 strictly on the value play means that the market cap for Volkswagen's ICE and hybrid businesses, minus any potential Porsche spinoff, should be €172.6 billion.

The EV top-up of €215.6 billion suggests that a more appropriate market value *as of yesterday* should have been €388.2 billion.

In other words, **VWAGY should have been trading at around $89.94 yesterday, folks!**

**EV Economy Matters**

[Volkswagen will switch to producing all its battery electric vehicles with bidirectional charging features next year.](https://thedriven.io/2021/04/07/volkswagen-wants-to-stabilise-grid-by-adding-v2g-in-all-its-electric-cars/)

> For the Volkswagen group, it will also set it apart from Tesla, which is more focused on having its cars on the road in service as autonomous taxis.

Forget comparisons of Tesla vs. Volkswagen to Apple vs. Samsung.  Tesla could very well be the Yahoo of EVs.  Volkswagen could very well be the Google of EVs.

**Ten-Bagger Opportunity?**

As for the more ambitious part, management released this mother of all Investor Presentations:

[Leading the Transformation](https://www.volkswagenag.com/presence/investorrelation/publications/presentations/2021/03/2021-03-16_Deep_Dive_Dahlheim.pdf)

Just how much of a mother of all Investor Presentations is this?

Many of those who have benefitted from the recent gold rush of EV startups will surely have noted the latter's Investor Presentations showing their respective paths to eventual sales and eventual profits.

VW's sales of 231,600 consumer EVs in 2020 dwarfs what any of these startups could ever achieve.  The company is aiming to achieve annual battery electric vehicle sales of 3,000,000 consumer EVs by 2025.  It is aiming to overtake Tesla itself by then, possibly even as early as next year!

That the future market leader in consumer EVs expects 3,000,000 consumer EVs to constitute a sales mix of only 20% means that it expects to steal market share from the dinosaurs amongst traditional / legacy / Big Auto manufacturers.  [Hello, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, Hyundai, Honda, Daimler, and Toyota!](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mls9iv/electric_vehicles_even_when_volkswagen_overtakes/)

If they sell only a little over half this, then consumer EV revenues should be in the neighborhood of €36.00 billion.

If they sell the full 3 million, then consumer EV revenues should be in the neighborhood of €71.86 billion.

Thus, the consumer EV business could, by 2025, be worth anywhere between €720.0 billion and €1,437.2 billion.

If they sell only half the 3 million by 2025, then Volkswagen can reach a value of €892.6 billion, or $1.1 trillion USD.

**If they sell the full 3 million by 2025, then the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, can realize a ten-bagger opportunity and reach a value of at least €1.6 trillion, or $1.9 trillion USD.**

Not trolling just trying to understand.
Comment by Green_Lantern_4vr: Didn’t say how you got to $40 from $42. 


VW didn’t sell that many EV. They sold a lot to themselves: https://cleantechnica.com/2021/02/19/how-many-volkswagen-id3-sales-volkswagen-sales-to-itself/


VW is far behind Tesla in EV technology and capex. VW will need to spend >$86 billion https://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-strategy-idUSKBN27T24O

I don’t know how much cash they have or gene rate but it doesn’t matter. That’s a lot of money. 


VW doesn’t have the charging network, the solar, the battery capacity, the power walls, or the autonomous driving. It will be behind. 


Dealerships don’t want to sell their EV’s: https://electrek.co/2020/12/17/study-german-dealers-refuse-to-sell-id-3-even-as-vw-talks-big-on-evs/



Dealers make 1/3 on EV than ICE: https://cleantechnica.com/2020/12/29/a-volkswagen-dealer-is-making-10-less-profit-selling-an-id-4-instead-of-fossil-fuel-vehicle-cleantechnica-exclusive/

Doesn’t sound good. 



No clue where you are getting those forecasted 2020 EV sales data or why it’s relevant. You don’t make any point about it. 


Tesla as a whole gets 20 P/S so VW EV should get 20 multiple too? What? Try comparing to Ford or gm lol. Absolutely mental valuation metric. 


Make sure to deduct the likely $100b from your refined calculation for the EV buildout cost. And make sure you lower your net profit if you’re doing any sort of weighted pricing because Vw margins will shrink as they split the difference with dealerships. 


Comparing EV startups to Vw is the funniest thing I’ve seen in an EV valuation. 


VW didn’t sell >230k EV in 2020. 


You forgot to deduct the ICE sales in your 10 bagger hahahahah.

Comment by None: Stumbled here from another thread, and it's been a very compelling read. I'm tending to side with you here, and am going to find a solid entry point in the next week. If you're wrong, worst case I go sideways.

However I do see a lot of what you're saying here. Most importantly I believe in your analysis.

Let's hope it's best case and VW makes me a millionaire!

Comment by Farscape1477: Shhhh, nein, nein.....
Comment by Mysterious_Look_2396: I still  don't understand why  so many people are putting so much faith in what " kathy" and ark think lately.
Comment by Torlek1: I looked at Ark's analysis, and I actually found it wanting.

They focused only on batteries, for some reason.
Comment by Torlek1: > Didn’t say how you got to $40 from $42.

The original article was a Seeking Article valuation article.

The author did a $42 valuation on the entire company, which I disagree with for two reasons.

The $2 deduction is based on [spinning out Porsche to raise funds for EV spending](https://www.carscoops.com/2021/03/porsche-has-explored-possibility-of-public-offering-exec-says/).

> VW will need to spend >$86 billion

So?  They already spent $50 billion of the total.

> VW doesn’t have the charging network, the solar, the battery capacity, the power walls, or the autonomous driving. It will be behind.

That's why it's building its own charging network and establishing a uniform battery format for its EVs.

> Dealerships don’t want to sell their EV’s

So?  That same article states that they're moving to a centralized model:

"By centralizing their sales efforts, they can sell cars online without relying on their evidently intransigent dealerships. This will hopefully make the sales experience less stressful for shoppers. But owners will still have access to VW’s large dealer network for service and support post-sale, which is a real benefit."

> No clue where you are getting those forecasted 2020 EV sales data or why it’s relevant. You don’t make any point about it.

2020 data is straight from their annual report.

> Make sure to deduct the likely $100b from your refined calculation for the EV buildout cost. And make sure you lower your net profit if you’re doing any sort of weighted pricing because Vw margins will shrink as they split the difference with dealerships.

Why?  Capex is not a reduction of enterprise value.

My valuation of VW's EV business is based strictly on *sales*, as should always be the case with disruptive technology.  Margin is irrelevant, let alone profits.

Unless you're talking about something like net sales, then that might be a different conversation, but net sales /= net margin.

> You forgot to deduct the ICE sales in your 10 bagger hahahahah.

Why deduct?  It should be added.

ICE and hybrid sales are valued based on the usual P/E metrics, hence the "value play" of €172.6 billion for ICE + Hybrid - Porsche.

Cash cows are future cash inflows, not liabilities.
Comment by Torlek1: Same here!  Good luck finding your starter position!
Comment by Green_Lantern_4vr: You should short Tesla bro
Comment by Modknowhesuck: Not a chance
Comment by Green_Lantern_4vr: Actually Ford will be the alibaba of Tesla of ev 😎😎😎😎 and vw will be the Alta vista.
Comment by HommeDeMerde99: do you own Volkswagen stock?  because what you're saying is otherwise insane.
Comment by Green_Lantern_4vr: What? How? 


Diesel cheating didn’t push EV? What? That was 2015 bro
Comment by Green_Lantern_4vr: She called Tesla stock price years out and was right.
Comment by Noah_Deez_Nutz: Me personally I never heard of her until 2020 so that tells me all I need to know as far as whether I should listen to her or not
Comment by Green_Lantern_4vr: You should tell them they r the stoopid
Comment by Green_Lantern_4vr: So? They already spent 50 of the 86? Where’s that? This was recent article saying +86. And so? That’s a lot of money. 


How much does the charging network cost. Is that caped forecasted already? Not cheap. 


So? What if that network doesn’t take off or is changed because it’s just one late entrant and doesn’t fit with the other networks. 


So? Do you think that could perhaps frustrate users with few charging or various charging services? So?


So? What about dealer agreements and incentive to sell? Does VW CFO sell cars or doesnVw dealer? So? Maybe that hurts sales? So? Sales are dollars which means 9 bagger lol not 20 bags! 


So 


You know what is an EV reduction? Debt. You know what debt is? So? Money. So. That’s money needed for capex. So. Reduces ev.

So? That means only 8 baggerbbb!!!! 


So! If they use cash that means less valuable stock probably because cash doesn’t depreciate as fast as capital assets. So? That means 7 bagger! 


So what if you’re using sales to derive EV you’re sales multiple is based on Tesla LOL. So how relevant do u think that is????


So sales doesn’t directly impact EV but it’s all related my son. So


So


Lolol add dice salsa that won’t exist. Okay sure. 


Where’s the value of ice and Porsche in ur numbers so? 


So. Maybe it’s not that good. 


So?
Comment by paperpeddler: In hell
Comment by Torlek1: Yes, and that's what **bubble stocks** are for.

I'm sure even Michael Burry will back away from POAHY, and any other VW position, once it grows too much for his liking.
Comment by Green_Lantern_4vr: They do. And they are blind
Comment by Mysterious_Look_2396: So that's all?
Comment by Torlek1: https://www.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1NL0JX

> You know what is an EV reduction? Debt.

They're raising money via other means.

Operating cash flow is the most important one.  Their ICE profits are funneled into EV spending.

Now, they understand the importance of going the equity route to raise money.

https://www.politico.eu/article/volkswagen-tesla-electric-vehicles-batteries/

> “It’s a mirror image to what Tesla has done, and it’s working,” said Matthias Schmidt, a Berlin-based auto analyst, citing the boom in VW’s share price — up more than 17 percent over the last week and nearing heights last seen before the 2015 Dieselgate emissions scandal. “It’s a carbon copy strategy, and **the whole reason is to try and get investors to pay for the electric transition**.”

Translation: EV pump and equity raises.
Comment by Green_Lantern_4vr: Or earth
Comment by Green_Lantern_4vr: Uhhh pretty much as far as I know. Maybe called some other tech or bio plays.
Comment by Green_Lantern_4vr: So? They’re raising money by either selling off assets, or diluting, or taking on debt, or using interact cash flow. Either way it is a reduction in value to the company. 


Ice profits will decrease over time. 


Okay so it’s dilution then. Diluting at an undervalued pricing. So? Means not good. Tesla issues some stock at sky high prices. Good.
Comment by Torlek1: No it's not a reduction!  You asked the wrong question!

Let me repeat: Whatever profits come from a single ICE car, if it goes into EV transition on a single EV, then any reduction in ICE value, based on P/E, is more than offset by P/S multiples on a single EV.

How many ICE vehicles can fuel the sale of a single EV?  That is the better question.

Also, they're not diluting yet.  The EV hype has only started.  That's very good.

Getting tutes to raise PTs so that the stock goes up more means they can raise at higher prices during the EV hype.
Comment by Green_Lantern_4vr: lol what? So? 


So you think that profit of car sales will be the sole use of EV sales and they are somehow intertwined? You are just so far gone dude. 


Enjoy your 10 bagger! Lmao

Comment by T4RSR5P84: Wow, I'm very surprised they increased their holding with PLUG.  I'm not complaining since I have long calls, but I know a lot of people were upset at how heavily weighted PLUG was since it took a hit from its all time high back in January of $75.  They must have a lot of faith in PLUG - hopefully this is a sign that the 'accounting errors' were minimal and not a huge issue.  

&#x200B;

Time will tell.  Thanks for sharing!
Comment by nevetando: That is a lot of eggs in one very shaky basket with Plug...
Comment by GrapeJuicex: I read April 16th is the big day for their rebalancing. Is that still true?
Comment by bigred91224: I've been bagholding ICLN (it's currently my only position that's red overall) waiting for some good news.  
  
Not sure what they're thinking buying more PLUG. I think I'll just take my loss and sell this shit.
Comment by Newyorkntilikina: This is one of my biggest regrets and one of my biggest mistake as an investor. I bought when Biden took office and has been dipping ever since. Hopefully it rebounds
Comment by None: Not happy about the increase of PLUG. I am strong on green energy, but not on PLUG. Not sure if I will keep holding long now
Comment by Gassy_Bird: I’m waiting to break even on ICLN and then put this money elsewhere lol
Comment by hopefultrader: more PLUG???????
Comment by bloppingzef: So I guess I was wrong. I’m definitely staying away from it now. Too much faith in Plug.
Comment by MerchantLAD: This thing has been dead in the water most of this year. Hoping the green sector picks up soon as that's where most of my individual stocks are.
Comment by WilhelmSuperhitler: What's 968? Could be XINYI Solar traded in Hong Kong. It fits the overall idea of ICLN.
Comment by None: Try FAN instead? It looks like it has broken away from the trends of ICLN, QCLN, TAN, etc. It also has a lower P/E ratio, which \*may\* mean it's more fairly priced.
Comment by Grymninja: LMAO they actually bought more PLUG ah as someone that chose to buy TAN at the ath (instead of icln) this makes me feel a little better.
Comment by Shaun8030: Dumped icln with a paltry 10 percent gain , put the money into qqqm. Sleep better now.
Comment by harrison_wintergreen: so their top holding is overvalued and unprofitable and had to re-state 2 years of earnings... but they sold 55 million shares of an undervalued, profitable company (118% return on capital!) that pays a 9% dividend yield? 

jebus, I don't know how anyone could invest in this piece of trash.
Comment by zdrup15: Really? More plug?

Man, I can't believe I bought 9 individual stocks this year and it's the clean energy etf the one giving me losses... This "rebalancing" actually makes me lose even more faith in the etf.
Comment by ysharm10: Thanks OP!
I wonder if ARKK will ever rebalance.
Comment by angus_supreme: Come on, Al Gore ETF!
Comment by VictorDanville: If Plug is down 55% since its ATH, wouldn't that suggest that there is now more upward pressure on its price than downward pressure?
Comment by Gary251927: I don’t Understand, PLUG was already their biggest holding when you all bought in? So why did you invest in the first place? It’s taken a dump recently like a lot of other stocks and everyone is now anti-plug.
Comment by JRshoe1997: Wow they really increased their position in PLUG lol. A company that has no major products, horrible financials, is dealing with lawsuits from different firms, and messed up their balance sheets. Literally that company is no different from NKLA. Also they decreased CIG and NOVA. If anything screams don’t buy this ETF its this.

Comment by hinthue: again PLUG? WTH
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: I can't speak for anyone else, but I think hydrogen has a better future than EV. Hydrogen production costs have fallen 40% since 2015,and are expected to fall by a further 40% through 2025. It's always been the fuel of the future, the issue is with making it safe to store. $2/kg is a potential tipping point that will make hydrogen competitive in multiple sectors, including power generation and long-range shipping. I have my eyes on $APD, personally I think thats a good long term bet, but PLUG is one of them more riskier plays. With their creation of Hydrogen plants, plus one of the biggest hydrogen plants in the US, I'm very confident they will be profitable in the future, but if they make any massive progress with their fuelcells, then I can easily see a mid triple digit price target. I do remember seeing somewhere that the hydrogen market would be worth $1 trillion somewhere, but I couldn't find the source for it, so don't trust me on the last point, but that was another reason why I'm bullish.
Comment by pWheff: $ICLN is tracking an index, there isn't faith involved.  It tracks S&P Global Clean Energy Index (SPGTCLEN), the purpose of that index is to index the strength of the clean energy market, not to provide investment returns.
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: I'm thinking the same way. I might buy some shares and DCA down if I get the opportunity over the next few weeks. $15-20 mil of shares bought is a lot to buy on a whim, I think they must have a good reason to believe these accounting errors really are nothing. Only time will tell, but I like the prospects of hydrogen anyways, so it's a company I don't mind buying into.
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: Someone else said that they're adding 70 more stocks to reduce volatility.
Comment by TODO_getLife: They are rebalancing very soon

Full plan: https://www.etfstream.com/news/blackrock-clean-energy-etf-index-to-triple-in-size-following-spdji-consultation/

They are going up to 100 holdings.
Comment by similiarintrests: I'm getting Lyxor clean energy ETF instead.
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: I'm not sure, but this is their latest portfolio. Maybe they will rebalance again, but having a big rebalancing wouldn't make sense, since they had also bought 130k shares as of March 31st. I think the whole big rebalancing thing was just speculation, but maybe someone else can prove me wrong.
Comment by cabeeza: Same here. Not sure if long-term genius move or boneheaded FOMO-ism
Comment by 3elieveIt: The ETF doesn't suck, you were just late. Stocks rise and fall AHEAD of news not on news. So the ETF was rising like crazy as the polls showed Biden would win. More than doubled its price in a year. You just bought at the top!
Comment by Negative-Road-8610: I did the same thing.  I bought ICLN when they were trading at around $30 and been buying more share to drive down my average cost.
Comment by TendyCrusader: You realize everyone was buying green energy before biden took office, just check the charts lmao. You played yourself

Look outside your window and count how many electric cars you see driving down the street.
Comment by CCChristopherson: RemindMe! 31 years
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: Well considering that they increased the majority of their positions, I think it would make it much easier to reach its previous numbers. I think $36 would be a stretch, but I can definitely see $30 before EOY if they continue to increase their positions at the dip
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: Ya, that's the one. Earnings are very good if I'm not mistaken, but it's a chinese listed company, so take it with a grain of salt
Comment by None: I’m sure black rock a 121B company knows a little bit more than you lmao. Also insider information they have, you do not.
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: If I had to take a guess, it could be that they see limited growth in the company. It peaked in 2012 and has been on a downward journey ever since. I also don't like that high dividend yield. That money could be going back into the company, but instead they pay out investors? And a 9% payout as well?
Comment by NiknameOne: ARKK rebalances every single day?
Comment by sefen92080: Wonder if u know arkk is actively managed!
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: I'm very confident it will break 30 at some point this year again. The question is when rather than if. They've increased their positions in the majority of stocks they hold, which means it should be relatively easy to push back to 30, compared to the last time.
Comment by SeakangarooKing: I would respectfully disagree. Between black, grey, blue & green hydrogen, hydrogen production will always be a byproduct of a industrial process. Becoming a dominant fuel source isn’t going to happen when it’s always second fiddle to electrification. That’s not to say hydrogen doesn’t have it’s place.  I wouldn’t be surprise if hydrogen gets a niche market like as a backup fuel for power turbine on high demand days on the grid.

Infrastructure investment (not just Biden’s plan) is going to towards electrification. And with EVs having dual purpose to store grid energy and transport people & goods. Why also develop mass infrastructure to widely transport & store hydrogen.

Again, hydrogen has it’s place but it’s not in the transportation sector. 

Full disclosure: I also have a large position in iCLN and I plan to hold.
Comment by VictorDanville: I prefer antimatter over hydrogen. Hydrogen is too inefficient.
Comment by None: They’re adding 70 more stocks on the 16th to the holding in order to reduce the volatility of this ETF
Comment by Arc-to-Arcturus: I only have a few shares (literally, a few), but my average price is $15/share.
Comment by TendyCrusader: someone bought the top :(
Comment by lyleberrycrunch: Stocks are forward looking so idk if I’d say that. ICLN had a couple bad months, so what, they’re still up like 100% in the past 12 months
Comment by OkejBerg: Few or many? In Norway EVs accounts for around 50% of all new car sales, they are everywhere. With the taxonomy coming into effect starting next year investment in ESG is bound to increase.

Comment by Promethesis: Also because Brazil is an absolute mess of a country right now — they’re managing risk
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: I like to hear opposition, if everyone agreed, the stock would be valued far higher than it is right now. However, what I will say is that there's a lot more to hydrogen than vehicles. Even so, the likes of airplanes and other heavy vehicles have no hope of running on electricity. With planes, the only feasible clean solutions for power are nuclear and hydrogen. If I'm not mistaken, Airbus began research into running planes with hydrogen fuel cells back in September 2020. Even without the transport industry, there's growing demand for hydrogen in the steel industry, for production of petroleum coke, and development in the cement  and power generations also account for a lot of growth in the hydrogen market. To add to this, growing regulations to control and curb the sulfur content in fuels is expected to drive the market for hydrogen generation. I have some far dated leaps on APD because I think it will grow massively over the next 2 years. As for transport, I think we all may end up pleasantly surprised. If you asked people whether they'd buy EV cars 5 years ago, they'd almost certainly say no. Like I said, PLUG is a bit of a lottery play, nobody knows where hydrogen fuel cells will end up in the next 5 years, just as nobody knew where EV cars would end up 5 years ago but I'm very confident they will be profitable in the near future with their hydrogen plants.
Comment by incognino123: > Again, hydrogen has it’s place but it’s not in the transportation sector

You're absolutely correct on this point, and outside of the mirai pretty much everyone in transportation agrees.  However, there's still several huge markets for hydrogen.  I'm not sure it's correct to call them niche as they may be bigger than the ev sector.  That being said, I'm not super keen on plug, hearing weird rumblings, and the latest spat with air doesn't sound good.
Comment by GrapeJuicex: Thanks!
Comment by 3elieveIt: Yep, I'm at about $16 average/share. No complaints
Comment by voneahhh: Forward looking doesn’t mean immediately profitable, nor should the expectation be. Oil isn’t forward looking at all and yet Exxon and Chevron haven’t gone out of business. Investors want to see products/services out there and being paid for.

>	ICLN had a couple bad months, so what, they’re still up like 100% in the past 12 months

That’s where we agree. Anyone complaining about ICLN dipping right now is being ludicrous.
Comment by john_cards85: I'm a little hesitant on the whole hydrogen thing myself but more so from a safety standpoint. I haven't heard anything about safety mechanisms in place and the last vehicles I can recall being powered by hydrogen we're zeppelins. Going back to the Hindenburg disaster, I've always been skeptical of a vehicle powered by hydrogen. What's to stop a similar series of auto related explosions in the event of collision? This maybe a really stupid point but it's definitely something I would want to know if I were a consumer looking to move into alternative energy vehicle ownership.
Comment by incognino123: This may be a concern for the most uninformed of consumers, but it's a little scary to see it on an investor forum, as you pointed out.  Lithium batteries are much scarier from an explosion standpoint in my mind.


Either way, moot point bc hydrogen in transportation is dead, except for maybe some weird edge cases like giant ships
Comment by zubotai: I think a lot of people don't realize that hydrogen fuel cell cars don't last as long.  Hydrogen bleeds off cause it's small andescapes. Also the fuel eats away at the engine and the welds from the inside.  I mean if they get fusion working then we might have a huge demand for it but thats unlikely in the next 5 years and by that time the EV market will be the norm.
Comment by john_cards85: I mean, you're not wrong, I literally just started hearing about hydrogen transportation within the last year so there's a lot of nuances I don't understand. I'm completely uninformed on how it works.
Comment by BuffsFan1: The fuel eats away at the engine…? Are you sure you’re looking at the right hydrogen vehicles? Hydrogen is not the fuel source…electricity is..created by a chemical reaction from the hydrogen cell…batteries are a part of a hydrogen vehicle and always will be. There’s no hydrogen fuel inside the electric engine. I think you may need to do some more research.
Comment by None: Hydrogen is only about as explosive as propane or natural gas, both of the latter being used in vehicles for years already.
Comment by zubotai: So the fuel cell last about 150k to 200k miles.  Then it needs to be replaced.  It's not a cheap part.  Also there is the cost of making the hydrogen itself.  You need to put more energy into the process to get hydrogen than you get out of the process.
Comment by BuffsFan1: Most gas-powered vehicles aren’t worth much at 150-200k as well. And your arguments are exactly what the issue was with Complete EVs in their infancy. That was overcome, just like this eventually will be 🤷‍♂️
Comment by zubotai: You still need to put more energy in then you get out with gas we get a net gain of 4% or so after drilling shipping and refining.  I'm not saying the hydrogen isn't an option but I don't see it overtaking EVs maybe it  can replace airline fuel and long haul trucking but daily drivers it won't not until we get a cheaper energy source.
Title : Whats changed with ICLN Holdings
ICLN recently published their holdings as of March 29th, and I haven't seen any posts addressing it, nor have I seen a post give the details of what's changed. Below is a table of the holdings before vs now. I've sorted it by their weight before, so you can see how the heavier stocks have shifted. There were cases where they gave 2 seperate columns for the same symbol, but I decided to keep them seperate for simplicity. Some notable changes:

\- iShares bought 200k more shares of PLUG

\- 65 million shares of ELP were bought

\- ICLN now holds €17 million in cash

\- 1.7 billion KRW was sold(Worth approx €12k)

\- The only position which was reduced was $NEOEN

&#x200B;Comment by I_are_facepalm: The fastest way to rebalance your portfolio is to just have a heavily weighted position lose value!

I should write articles!
Comment by seriouslybrohuh: Okay now get to $30 by eom, please and thank you. My calls are on their last breath
Comment by chugler92: Enph is the best company in there why not just buy them ?
Comment by North3rnLigh7s: Looks like they’ve added more PLUG. 🤦🏻‍♂️ ffs
Comment by coolcomfort123: I hope this etf can go back to $30.
Comment by turkeychicken: Thanks for reposting this with the table sorted by weight.  I'm happy they reduced their weight in PLUG (the previous table you posted must have been incorrect because it showed they doubled it, lol).

I'm really hopeful the new balancing helps things with this ETF.  Nothing looks too crazy, but the reduction in PLUG alone makes me happy, haha.

If anyone has trouble scrolling the table, check out the post on [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com)
Comment by gunter829: The increase in PLUG is super interesting especially for a company that is quite literally all over the place. 

Ima revisit ICLN when it becomes a long in my portfolio.
Comment by dr_donk_: Still need to cut down on PlUG and they are not..
Comment by None: What's changed is I sold it
Comment by MistaBluejay: I feel like I read about a filing to allow them to add more companies to the fund's holdings
Comment by RonStampler: Is ICLN still a solid ETF to invest in? I just started researching renewables today and there's so many god damn companies that I just want to go in to an ETF at this point, but I dont want to get burnt on reddit hype which this looks to have recieved.
Comment by Retrooo: Quality Motley Fool content.
Comment by earthmann: They have no moat.
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: It might look like a bad move now, but ICLN isn't really a short term stock. I feel like they're hedging for the future, in the hopes that PLUG commits to their promises coming closer to 2022 (I think thats when they said they'd be profitable). I agree that PLUG does cause a lot of volatility, but with €17 million in cash on hand, I feel like they're looking to buy the next dip that shows up.
Comment by shawcphet1: Yea I still really like plug but having the stock revolve so heavily around a volatile stock like plug is kind of annoying. Definitely one of the most volatile etfs I’ve invested in besides ARK etfs
Comment by elaguila083: The good news is the momentum seems to be starting to turn around, particularly with the wind companies
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: I could see it going back to $30 considering they've increased their positions in most of the stocks. It just depends on whether they bought at the top or the bottom.
Comment by WilhelmSuperhitler: They reduced their weight in PLUG by way of losing money on it. Looks to me that the number of shares now is higher than the number of shares before.
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: Ya, I realised that after posting, It stumped me for a good few minutes, but I decided to just delete the post and change it before posting again because there were a couple more issues I wanted to fix.
Comment by shawcphet1: Plug has legs still. They could at least wait to cut down til it gets back to the $45-$50 range. I think the company just got ahead of itself and could hit $100 though.
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: In my honest opinion, I still think this is a bit overpriced in the longterm. I think we've priced in the future of these companies way too early, but I think in the short term, there's a strong possibility for growth. I feel like $20-22 at most, is a fair price for ICLN right now, but as you've seen over the past months, this market is irrational. People want to jump in on the clean energy hype.
Comment by mrcet007: Why don't they have moat?
Comment by coopsta133: Isn’t 17mill pennies for an etf like this?
Comment by Smoke-and-Mirrors1: Wish they were going heavier in wind and perhaps solar. Seems more solid and realistic cash generation long term.
Comment by turkeychicken: Ugh, you're right haha.  i should have looked at the share count
Comment by elaguila083: I dunno ask Enphase
Comment by earthmann: There were regulatory changes that pertained to, I think, inverters. A lot of companies lost compliance overnight. 

Enphase was the only company operating at scale that wasn’t effected by the new standards, so they had the market to themselves, but over time this advantage shrinks as other manufacturers get aligned.

Whatever success they have in the future will depend on using their clout to form partnerships, deepen integration into other systems, and/or expand their repertoire. 

The bear case is that their key products will end up competing on price, losing as commodification kills margins.

Something like that...
Comment by Traditional_Fee_8828: You're right, but it's far more than the 100k they had only a month ago. If I had to guess, they sold some of their shares as the stocks moved upwards, and began buying them back on the downward move, and ended up with extra cash on hand.
Comment by well-lighted: According to the fact sheet, the whole fund is worth about $80mil, so $17mil is quite a lot.
Comment by elaguila083: I agree. I'm loaded up in FAN
Comment by None: [deleted]
Comment by coopsta133: It’s 5.3billion in assets. No way is an ishares 80 mill
Comment by earthmann: Well, that’s nice to say but in this case I’m just repeating what I read somewhere.

I can’t tell you anything about DQ that you don’t know, but... 

I’ve holding a few bags right and I was thinking about companies that have taken a rotation hit or whatever, the price has dipped down in a way that has nothing to do with the company itself, but rather some macro issue that I think will resolve itself.  So hold-on, and wait for the price to get back up.

Why should I not sell the stock, realize a tax-deductible loss, and buy stock in a sector that is also effected by the same macro forces. Recovery is recovery right? By jumping ship, I can create a beneficial tax event without changing my risk too much. 

I’d heard the term “loss harvesting,” but I had never thought about it. I don’t even know if this is it, but it’s something that I wish I had thought of earlier...
Title : $RMO is uniquely positioned to turn EV upside down
 What is the biggest thing holding EV adoption back? Batteries. The company that solves this could be responsible for shifting everything to EV.

Jim Cramer and BorgWarner CEO Fred Lissalde discuss how 45% of Borg Warner revenue will be tied to EV tech by 2030. Lissalde is specifically bullish on $RMO who Borg Warner has a 20% stake in. Who do you think will be supplying the battery tech??? :)

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/borgwarner-expects-evs-to-account-for-almost-50percent-of-revenue-by-2030.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/borgwarner-expects-evs-to-account-for-almost-50percent-of-revenue-by-2030.html)

[https://eepower.com/news/borgwarner-and-romeo-power-technology-form-ev-battery-module-joint-venture/#](https://eepower.com/news/borgwarner-and-romeo-power-technology-form-ev-battery-module-joint-venture/#)

Additionally, $RMO and Ecellix have signed an MOU.

[https://www.greencarcongress.com/2021/02/20210222-ecellix.html](https://www.greencarcongress.com/2021/02/20210222-ecellix.html)

Have people read the description of Ecellix's eCell technology? Ecellix is Romeo's strategic partner. My gut feeling is that Ecellix can do what QS is claiming, and they are way ahead of QS considering they are working with Romeo to get their cells tested and moving forward with packing. They must be working on packing their cells already if they went ahead with partnering with Romeo. Ecellix just does not call it "Solid state battery". In fact, QS is not completely solid state. They use liquid to some extent. If Romeo/Excellix can move trucks, then it would be a cake to move passenger cars. With BorgWarner backing up Romeo, it will turn VW's vision upside down. GM, Ford, etc will come to BorgWarner/Romeo/Ecellix. Guess who would want it the most even if it has to pay high price. FISKER

Right now $RMO is a joke under $12. With an earnings call this week and a potential announcement from the company to get those warrants exercised, $20 is a very reasonable starting point. Either way, Romeo is perfectly positioned to be a major distruptor in a disruptive industry.Comment by twitterisskynet: God I hope so I'm getting shredded being bullish on rmo
Comment by mlord99: Imo u have better battery plays like Microvast outthere...
Comment by penisthightrap_: What puts them in position better than someone, like say, Samsung, Panasonic, or LG? 

Samsung makes some of the best lithium ion cells for consumers currently, imo. Seems risky to bet that someone like Romeo has some technology advantage over a large company who has a large budget for product research. Although, whoever makes a big breakthrough will make a large profit. Batteries/energy storage is a large barrier for green energy.

What a dumpster fire.
Comment by None: This is literally what you just posted in the daily thread.
Comment by Torlek1: So how exactly will Romeo "turn VW's vision upside town"?

The latter isn't a chump.  It is nothing less than the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto.
Comment by Muted-Ad-6689: Well this aged poorly
Comment by OppressedDeskJockey: Me too man. How about now? Is there any shreds left?
Comment by None: Rmo earnings crushed.
Shortage of cells...
Guess who makes cells, packs and modules? Ding ding ding Microvast
Comment by beesemode: Romeo doesn’t make batteries, they design and package them as battery packs. That’s their main IP, packing cells in the most efficient way possible. If you watched Tesla’s most recent battery day you know that that’s a huge challenge. I don’t know why so many people think Romeo makes battery cells.
Comment by mcastleberg: Horrendous management has set them back
Comment by xhavez: Well this aged poorly post aged poorly.
Comment by mcastleberg: That’s one way of putting it
Comment by twitterisskynet: No choice but to hold for foreseeable future at least 3-5 years. I'm down too much to sell it off it's all or nothing at this point. At least they are still making deals teaming up with pacaar was big
Comment by mlord99: My heavy bags are happy to hear that😁
Comment by penisthightrap_: That makes sense and it's not something I would have thought of. Thank you
Comment by Logface123: So they really don’t compete with QS, Microvast, and the other EV battery SPACs then? They could theoretically work with any of them, correct?
Comment by beesemode: QS is trying to make solid state batteries. Romeo makes high efficiency Li ion battery packs. Solid state is definitely the future, but has never been manufactured at scale and could be decades away from making it into a car. Long story short I think there’s room for all those companies, just different battery solutions
